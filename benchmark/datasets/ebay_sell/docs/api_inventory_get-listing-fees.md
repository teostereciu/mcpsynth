# getListingFees

This call is used to retrieve the expected listing fees for up to 250 unpublished offers. An array of one or more <strong>offerId</strong> values are passed in under the <strong>offers</strong> container.<br><br>In the response payload, all listing fees are grouped by eBay marketplace, and listing fees per offer are not shown. A <strong>fees</strong> container will be returned for each eBay marketplace where the seller is selling the products associated with the specified offers. <br><br>Errors will occur if the seller passes in <strong>offerIds</strong> that represent published offers, so this call should be made before the seller publishes offers with the <strong>publishOffer</strong>.
