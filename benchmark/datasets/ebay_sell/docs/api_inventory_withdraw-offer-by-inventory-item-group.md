# withdrawOfferByInventoryItemGroup

This call is used to end a multiple-variation eBay listing that is associated with the specified inventory item group. This call only ends multiple-variation eBay listing associated with the inventory item group but does not delete the inventory item group object. Similarly, this call also does not delete any of the offers associated with the inventory item group, but instead all of these offers go into the unpublished state. If the seller wanted to relist the multiple-variation eBay listing, they could use the <strong>publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup</strong> method.
