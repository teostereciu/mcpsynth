# Contest Payment Dispute

This method is used if the seller wishes to contest a payment dispute initiated by the buyer. The unique identifier of the payment dispute is passed in as a path parameter, and unique identifiers for payment disputes can be retrieved with the <strong>getPaymentDisputeSummaries</strong> method.<br><br><span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> Before contesting a payment dispute, the seller must upload all supporting files using the <strong>addEvidence</strong> and <strong>updateEvidence</strong> methods. Once the seller has officially contested the dispute (using <strong>contestPaymentDispute</strong>), the <strong>addEvidence</strong> and <strong>updateEvidence</strong> methods can no longer be used. In the <strong>evidenceRequests</strong> array of the <strong>getPaymentDispute</strong> response, eBay prompts the seller with the type of supporting file(s) that will be needed to contest the payment dispute.</span><br><br>If a seller decides to contest a payment dispute, that seller should be prepared to provide supporting documents such as proof of delivery, proof of authentication, or other documents. The type of supporting documents that the seller will provide will depend on why the buyer filed the payment dispute.<br><br>The <strong>revision</strong> field in the request payload is required, and the <strong>returnAddress</strong> field should be supplied if the seller is expecting the buyer to return the item. See the Request Payload section for more information on these fields.
