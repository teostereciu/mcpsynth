# bulkPublishOffer

<span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> Each listing can be revised up to 250 times in one calendar day. If this revision threshold is reached, the seller will be blocked from revising the item until the next calendar day.</span><br>This call is used to convert unpublished offers (up to 25) into  published offers, or live eBay listings. The unique identifier (<strong>offerId</strong>) of each offer to publish is passed into the request payload. It is possible that some unpublished offers will be successfully created into eBay listings, but others may fail. The response payload will show the results for each <strong>offerId</strong> value that is passed into the request payload. The <strong>errors</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong> containers will be returned for an offer that had one or more issues being published. <br><br><div class="msgbox_important"><p class="msgbox_importantInDiv" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #dd1e31;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Important! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b><span style="color: #dd1e31;" class="mcFormatColor">Important!</span></b></span></span>Publish offer note: Fields may be optional or conditionally required when calling the create or update methods, but become required when publishing the offer to create active listings. For this method, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/inventory/publishing-offers.html#offer" target="_blank">Offer fields</a> for a list of fields required to publish an offer.</p></span></div><br>For those who prefer to publish one offer per call, the <strong>publishOffer</strong> method can be used instead. In the case of a multiple-variation listing, the <strong>publishOfferByInventoryItemGroup</strong> call should be used instead, as this call will convert all unpublished offers associated with an inventory item group into a multiple-variation listing.
