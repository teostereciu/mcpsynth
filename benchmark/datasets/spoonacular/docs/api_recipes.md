## Search Recipes

Search through thousands of recipes using advanced filtering and ranking. NOTE: This method combines searching by query, by ingredients, and by nutrients into one endpoint.

If you are making a "what's in your fridge?" style app and require more filters than the Search Recipes by Ingredients endpoint allows, use the sort parameters max-used-ingredients or min-missing-ingredients with this endpoint instead.

## Taste by ID

Get a recipe's taste. The tastes supported are sweet, salty, sour, bitter, savory, and fatty. These tastes are between 0 and 100 while the spiciness value is in scoville on an open scale of 0 and above.

Every ingredient has each of these values and it is weighted by how much they contribute to the recipe. Spiciness is taking the weight of the spicy ingredient and multiplying it with its scoville amount. Of course, taste is also very personal and it depends on how it is prepared so all of the values should only give you an indication of how the dish tastes.

## Extract Recipe from Website

This endpoint lets you extract recipe data such as title, ingredients, and instructions from any properly formatted website.

The API can also watch and extract recipes from videos that you can typically find on Facebook Reels, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Pinterest Pins, or TikTok Shorts. Since this requires much more compute resources extraction from videos is turned off by default. You can set `extractFromVideo` to `true` if you want to support these kinds of recipe links (be aware that this costs extra points and a longer response time).

Furthermore, if you set `includeNutrition` to `true`, you will receive a full nutritional profile of the recipe - independent of whether the original source has any nutrition information. spoonacular will compute the nutrition itself.

GET

https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/extract

#### Headers

Response Headers:

  * `Content-Type: application/json`


#### Parameters

Name | Type | Example | Description
---|---|---|---
**`url`** | string | https://foodista.com/recipe/ZHK4KPB6/chocolate-crinkle-cookies | The URL of the recipe page.
`extractFromVideo` | boolean | false | If true and the URL points to a video recipe, for example a tiktok, youtube, facebook reel, or instagram reel video the API tries to extract the recipe from the video. This might take up to 30 seconds. If the URL is NOT a video URL this won't have any effect.
`forceExtraction` | boolean | true | If true, the extraction will be triggered whether we already know the recipe or not. Use this only if information is missing as this operation is slower.
`analyze` | boolean | false | If true, the recipe will be analyzed and classified resolving in more data such as cuisines, dish types, and more.
`includeNutrition` | boolean | false | Whether nutrition data should be added to correctly parsed ingredients.
`includeTaste` | boolean | false | Whether taste data should be added to correctly parsed ingredients.
