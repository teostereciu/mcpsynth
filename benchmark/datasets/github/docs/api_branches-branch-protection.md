## Update branch protection
Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, seeGitHub's productsin the GitHub Help documentation.
Protecting a branch requires admin or owner permissions to the repository.
Note
Passing new arrays ofusersandteamsreplaces their previous values.
Note
The list of users, apps, and teams in total is limited to 100 items.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Update branch protection"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
