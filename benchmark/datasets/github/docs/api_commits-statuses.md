# REST API endpoints for commit statuses
Use the REST API to interact with commit statuses.

## About commit statuses
You can use the REST API to allow external services to mark commits with anerror,failure,pending, orsuccessstate, which is then reflected in pull requests involving those commits. Statuses can also include an optionaldescriptionandtarget_url, and we highly recommend providing them as they make statuses much more useful in the GitHub UI.
As an example, one common use is for continuous integration services to mark commits as passing or failing builds using status. Thetarget_urlwould be the full URL to the build output, and thedescriptionwould be the high level summary of what happened with the build.
Statuses can include acontextto indicate what service is providing that status. For example, you may have your continuous integration service push statuses with a context ofci, and a security audit tool push statuses with a context ofsecurity. You can then use the REST API toGet the combined status for a specific referenceto retrieve the whole status for a commit.
Note that therepo:statusOAuth scopegrants targeted access to statuseswithoutalso granting access to repository code, while thereposcope grants permission to code as well as statuses.
If you are developing a GitHub App  and want to provide more detailed information about an external service, you may want to use the REST API to manage checks. For more information, seeREST API endpoints for checks.

## Get the combined status for a specific reference
Users with pull access in a repository can access a combined view of commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name.
Additionally, a combinedstateis returned. Thestateis one of:
- failureif any of the contexts report aserrororfailure
- pendingif there are no statuses or a context ispending
- successif the latest status for all contexts issuccess

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Get the combined status for a specific reference"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
- GitHub App installation access tokens
- Fine-grained personal access tokens
The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:
- "Commit statuses" repository permissions (read)
This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.

## List commit statuses for a reference
Users with pull access in a repository can view commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name. Statuses are returned in reverse chronological order. The first status in the list will be the latest one.
This resource is also available via a legacy route:GET /repos/:owner/:repo/statuses/:ref.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "List commit statuses for a reference"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
- GitHub App installation access tokens
- Fine-grained personal access tokens
The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:
- "Commit statuses" repository permissions (read)
This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.
