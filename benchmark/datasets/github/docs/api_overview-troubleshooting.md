# Troubleshooting the REST API
Learn how to diagnose and resolve common problems for the REST API.

## In this article

## Rate limit errors
GitHub enforces rate limits to ensure that the API stays available for all users. For more information, seeRate limits for the REST API.
If you exceed your primary rate limit, you will receive a403 Forbiddenor429 Too Many Requestsresponse, and thex-ratelimit-remainingheader will be0. If you exceed a secondary rate limit, you will receive a403 Forbiddenor429 Too Many Requestsresponse and an error message that indicates that you exceeded a secondary rate limit.
If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily according to these guidelines:
- If theretry-afterresponse header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
- If thex-ratelimit-remainingheader is0, you should not make another request until after the time specified by thex-ratelimit-resetheader. Thex-ratelimit-resetheader is in UTC epoch seconds.
- Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.
Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.
For more information about how to avoid exceeding the rate limits, seeBest practices for using the REST API.

## 404 Not Foundfor an existing resource

```
404 Not Found
```
If you make a request to access a private resource and your request isn't properly authenticated, you will receive a404 Not Foundresponse. GitHub uses a404 Not Foundresponse instead of a403 Forbiddenresponse to avoid confirming the existence of private repositories.
If you get a404 Not Foundresponse when you know that the resource that you are requesting exists, you should check your authentication. For example:
- If you are using a personal access token (classic), you should ensure that:The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, seeScopes for OAuth appsandManaging your personal access tokens.The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, you should ensure that:The token has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.The resource owner that was specified for the token matches the owner of the resource that the endpoint will affect. For more information, seeManaging your personal access tokens.The token has access to any private repositories that the endpoint will affect. For more information, seeManaging your personal access tokens.The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- If you are using a GitHub App installation access token, you should ensure that:The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the account where the GitHub App is installed.The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- If you are using a GitHub App user access token, you should ensure that:The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.The user has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.The user has approved any updated permissions for your GitHub App. For more information, seeApproving updated permissions for a GitHub App.
- If you are using an OAuth app user access token, you should ensure that:The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, seeScopes for OAuth apps.The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.The organization has not blocked OAuth app access, if you are using an endpoint that will affect resources owned by an organization. App owners cannot see whether their app is blocked, but they can instruct users of the app to check this. For more information, seeAbout OAuth app access restrictions.The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- If you are usingGITHUB_TOKENin a GitHub Actions workflow, you should ensure that:The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the repository where the workflow is running. If you need to access resources outside of that repository, such as resources owned by an organization or resources owned by another repository, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App.
- The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, seeScopes for OAuth appsandManaging your personal access tokens.
- The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
- The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- The token has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
- The resource owner that was specified for the token matches the owner of the resource that the endpoint will affect. For more information, seeManaging your personal access tokens.
- The token has access to any private repositories that the endpoint will affect. For more information, seeManaging your personal access tokens.
- The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
- The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
- The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the account where the GitHub App is installed.
- The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
- The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
- The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
- The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
- The user has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
- The user has approved any updated permissions for your GitHub App. For more information, seeApproving updated permissions for a GitHub App.
- The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, seeScopes for OAuth apps.
- The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
- The organization has not blocked OAuth app access, if you are using an endpoint that will affect resources owned by an organization. App owners cannot see whether their app is blocked, but they can instruct users of the app to check this. For more information, seeAbout OAuth app access restrictions.
- The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, seeToken expiration and revocation.
- The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the repository where the workflow is running. If you need to access resources outside of that repository, such as resources owned by an organization or resources owned by another repository, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App.
For more information about authentication, seeAuthenticating to the REST API.
You should also check for typos in your URL. For example, adding a trailing slash to the endpoint will result in a404 Not Found. You can refer to the reference documentation for the endpoint to confirm that you have the correct URL.
Additionally, any path parameters must be URL encoded. For example, any slashes in the parameter value must be replaced with%2F. If you don't properly encode any slashes in the parameter name, the endpoint URL will be misinterpreted.

## Missing results
Most endpoints that return a list of resources support pagination. For most of these endpoints, only the first 30 resources are returned by default. In order to see all of the resources, you need to paginate through the results. For more information, seeUsing pagination in the REST API.
If you are using pagination correctly and still do not see all of the results that you expect, you should confirm that the authentication credentials that you used have access to all of the expected resources. For example, if you are using a GitHub App installation access token, if the installation was only granted access to a subset of repositories in an organization, any request for all repositories in that organization will return only the repositories that the app installation can access.

## Requires authentication when using basic authentication
Basic authentication with your username and password is not supported. Instead, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App or OAuth app. For more information, seeAuthenticating to the REST API.

## Timeouts
If GitHub takes more than 10 seconds to process an API request, GitHub will terminate the request and you will receive a timeout response and a "Server Error" message.
GitHub reserves the right to change the timeout window to protect the speed and reliability of the API.
You can check the status of the REST API atgithubstatus.comto determine whether the timeout is due to a problem with the API. You can also try to simplify your request or try your request later. For example, if you are requesting 100 items on a page, you can try requesting fewer items.

## Resource not accessible
If you are using a GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token and you receive a "Resource not accessible by integration" or "Resource not accessible by personal access token" error, then your token has insufficient permissions. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
You can use theX-Accepted-GitHub-Permissionsheader to identify the permissions that are required to access the REST API endpoint.
The value of theX-Accepted-GitHub-Permissionsheader is a comma separated list of the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. Occasionally, you can choose from multiple permission sets. In these cases, multiple comma-separated lists will be separated by a semicolon.
For example:
- X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: contents=readmeans that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs read access to the contents permission.
- X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: pull_requests=write,contents=readmeans that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs write access to the pull request permission and read access to the contents permission.
- X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: pull_requests=read,contents=read; issues=read,contents=readmeans that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs either read access to the pull request permission and read access to the contents permission, or read access to the issues permission and read access to the contents permission.

## Problems parsing JSON
If you send invalid JSON in the request body, you may receive a400 Bad Requestresponse and a "Problems parsing JSON" error message. You can use a linter or JSON validator to help you identify errors in your JSON.

## Body should be a JSON object
If the endpoint expects a JSON object and you do not format your request body as a JSON object, you may receive a400 Bad Requestresponse and a "Body should be a JSON object" error message.

## Invalid request
If you omit required parameters or you use the wrong type for a parameter, you may receive a422 Unprocessable Entityresponse and an "Invalid request" error message. For example, you will get this error if you specify a parameter value as an array but the endpoint is expecting a string. You can refer to the reference documentation for the endpoint to verify that you are using the correct parameter types and that you are including all of the required parameters.

## Validation Failed
If your request could not be processed, you may receive a422 Unprocessable Entityresponse and a "Validation Failed" error message. The response body will include anerrorsproperty, which includes acodeproperty to help you diagnose the problem.

[TABLE]
Code | Description
missing | A resource does not exist.
missing_field | A parameter that was required was not specified. Review the documentation for the endpoint to see what parameters are required.
invalid | The formatting of a parameter is invalid. Review the endpoint documentation for more specific information.
already_exists | Another resource has the same value as one of your parameters. This can happen in resources that must have some unique key (such as label names).
unprocessable | The parameters that were provided were invalid.
custom | Refer to themessageproperty to diagnose the error.

## Not a supported version
You should use theX-GitHub-Api-Versionheader to specify an API version. For example:

```
curl --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version:2026-03-10" https://api.github.com/zen
```

```
curl --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version:2026-03-10" https://api.github.com/zen
```
If you specify a version that does not exist, you will receive a400 Bad Requesterror and a message about the version not being supported.
For more information, seeAPI Versions.

## User agent required
Requests without a validUser-Agentheader will be rejected. You should use your username or the name of your application for theUser-Agentvalue.
curl sends a validUser-Agentheader by default.

## Other errors
If you observe an error that is not addressed here, you should refer to the error message that the API gives you. Most error messages will provide a clue about what is wrong and a link to relevant documentation.
If you observe unexpected failures, you can usegithubstatus.comor theGitHub status APIto check for incidents affecting the API.
