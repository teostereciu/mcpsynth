# REST API endpoints for gists
Use the REST API to list, create, update and delete the public gists on GitHub.

## About gists
You can use the REST API to view and modify gists. For more information about gists, seeEditing and sharing content with gists.

### Authentication
You can read public gists  anonymously, but you must be signed into GitHub to create gists. To read or write gists on a user's behalf, you need the gist OAuth scope and a token. For more information, seeScopes for OAuth apps.

### Truncation
The API provides up to one megabyte of content for each file in the gist. Each file returned for a gist through the API has a key calledtruncated. Iftruncatedistrue, the file is too large and only a portion of the contents were returned incontent.
If you need the full contents of the file, you can make aGETrequest to the URL specified byraw_url. Be aware that for files larger than ten megabytes, you'll need to clone the gist via the URL provided bygit_pull_url.
In addition to a specific file's contents being truncated, the entire files list may be truncated if the total number exceeds 300 files. If the top leveltruncatedkey istrue, only the first 300 files have been returned in the files list. If you need to fetch all of the gist's files, you'll need to clone the gist via the URL provided bygit_pull_url.
