# REST API endpoints for Git references
Use the REST API to interact with references in your Git database on GitHub

## About Git references
A Git reference (git ref) is a file that contains a Git commit SHA-1 hash. When referring to a Git commit, you can use the Git reference, which is an easy-to-remember name, rather than the hash. The Git reference can be rewritten to point to a new commit. A branch is a Git reference that stores the new Git commit hash. These endpoints allow you to read and writereferencesto your Git database on GitHub.

## List matching references
Returns an array of references from your Git database that match the supplied name. The:refin the URL must be formatted asheads/<branch name>for branches andtags/<tag name>for tags. If the:refdoesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with:ref, they will be returned as an array.
When you use this endpoint without providing a:ref, it will return an array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is returned, not justheadsandtags.
Note
You need to explicitlyrequest a pull requestto trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests. For more information, see "Checking mergeability of pull requests".
If you request matching references for a branch namedfeaturebut the branchfeaturedoesn't exist, the response can still include other matching head refs that start with the wordfeature, such asfeatureAandfeatureB.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "List matching references"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
- GitHub App installation access tokens
- Fine-grained personal access tokens
The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:
- "Contents" repository permissions (read)
This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.
