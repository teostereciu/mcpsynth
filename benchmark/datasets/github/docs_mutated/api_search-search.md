# REST API endpoints for search
Use the REST API to search for specific items on GitHub.

## About search
You can use the REST API to search for the specific item you want to find. For example, you can find a user or a specific file in a repository. Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs. To satisfy that need, the GitHub REST API providesup to 1,000 results for each search.
You can narrow your search using queries. To learn more about the search query syntax, seeREST API endpoints for search.

### Ranking search results
Unless another sort option is provided as a query parameter, results are sorted by best match in descending order. Multiple factors are combined to boost the most relevant item to the top of the result list.

### Rate limit
The REST API has a custom rate limit for searching. For authenticated requests, you can make up to
30 requests per minute for all search endpoints except for theSearch codeendpoint. TheSearch codeendpoint requires you to authenticate and limits you to 9 requests per minute. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.
For information about how to determine your current rate limit status, seeRate Limit.

### Constructing a search query
Each endpoint for searching usesquery parametersto perform searches on GitHub. See the individual endpoints for examples that include the endpoint and query parameters.
A query can contain any combination of search qualifiers supported on GitHub. The format of the search query is:

```
SEARCH_KEYWORD_1 SEARCH_KEYWORD_N QUALIFIER_1 QUALIFIER_N
```

```
SEARCH_KEYWORD_1 SEARCH_KEYWORD_N QUALIFIER_1 QUALIFIER_N
```
For example, if you wanted to search for allrepositoriesowned bydefunktthat
contained the wordGitHubandOctocatin the README file, you would use the
following query with thesearch repositoriesendpoint:

```
GitHub Octocat in:readme user:defunkt
```

```
GitHub Octocat in:readme user:defunkt
```
Note:Be sure to use your language's preferred HTML-encoder to construct your query strings. For example:

```
// JavaScriptconstqueryString ='q='+encodeURIComponent('GitHub Octocat in:readme user:defunkt');
```

```
// JavaScriptconstqueryString ='q='+encodeURIComponent('GitHub Octocat in:readme user:defunkt');
```
SeeSearching on GitHubfor a complete list of available qualifiers, their format, and an example of
how to use them. For information about how to use operators to match specific
quantities, dates, or to exclude results, seeUnderstanding the search syntax.

### Limitations on query length
You cannot use queries that:
- Are longer than 256 characters (not including operators or qualifiers).
- Have more than fiveAND,OR, orNOToperators.
These search queries will return a "Validation failed" error message.

### Search scope limits
To keep the REST API fast for everyone, we limit the number of repositories a query will search through. The REST API will find up to 4,000 repositories that match your filters and return results from those repositories.

### Timeouts and incomplete results
To keep the REST API fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query
can run. For queries thatexceed the time limit,
the API returns the matches that were already found prior to the timeout, and
the response has theincomplete_resultsproperty set totrue.
Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete.
More results might have been found, but also might not.

### Access errors or missing search results
You need to successfully authenticate and have access to the repositories in your search queries, otherwise, you'll see a422 Unprocessable Entryerror with a "Validation Failed" message. For example, your search will fail if your query includesrepo:,user:, ororg:qualifiers that request resources that you don't have access to when you sign in on GitHub.
When your search query requests multiple resources, the response will only contain the resources that you have access to and willnotprovide an error message listing the resources that were not returned.
For example, if your search query searches for theoctocat/testandcodertocat/testrepositories, but you only have access tooctocat/test, your response will show search results foroctocat/testand nothing forcodertocat/test. This behavior mimics how search works on GitHub.

### Text match metadata
On GitHub, you can use the context provided by code snippets and highlights in search results. The endpoints for searching return additional metadata that allows you to highlight the matching search terms when displaying search results.
Requests can opt to receive those text fragments in the response, and every fragment is accompanied by numeric offsets identifying the exact location of each matching search term.
To get this metadata in your search results, specify thetext-matchmedia type in yourAcceptheader.

```
application/vnd.github.text-match+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.text-match+json
```
When you provide thetext-matchmedia type, you will receive an extra key in the JSON payload calledtext_matchesthat provides information about the position of your search terms within the text and thepropertythat includes the search term. Inside thetext_matchesarray, each object includes
the following attributes:

[TABLE]
Name | Description
object_url | The URL for the resource that contains a string property matching one of the search terms.
object_type | The name for the type of resource that exists at the givenobject_url.
property | The name of a property of the resource that exists atobject_url. That property is a string that matches one of the search terms. (In the JSON returned fromobject_url, the full content for thefragmentwill be found in the property with this name.)
fragment | A subset of the value ofproperty. This is the text fragment that matches one or more of the search terms.
matches | An array of one or more search terms that are present infragment. The indices (i.e., "offsets") are relative to the fragment. (They are not relative to thefullcontent ofproperty.)
[/TABLE]

```
object_type
```

#### Example
Using acurlcommand, and theexample issue searchabove, our API
request would look like this:

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.text-match+json' \
'https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=windows+label:bug \
+language:python+issue_state:open&sort=created&order=asc'
```

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.text-match+json' \
'https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=windows+label:bug \
+language:python+issue_state:open&sort=created&order=asc'
```
The response will include atext_matchesarray for each search result. In the JSON below, we have two objects in thetext_matchesarray.
The first text match occurred in thebodyproperty of the issue. We see a fragment of text from the issue body. The search term (windows) appears twice within that fragment, and we have the indices for each occurrence.
The second text match occurred in thebodyproperty of one of the issue's comments. We have the URL for the issue comment. And of course, we see a fragment of text from the comment body. The search term (windows) appears once within that fragment.

```
{"text_matches":[{"object_url":"https://api.github.com/repositories/215335/issues/132","object_type":"Issue","property":"body","fragment":"comprehensive windows font I know of).\n\nIf we can find a commonly
      distributed windows font that supports them then no problem (we can use html

```

## Search code
Searches for query terms inside of a file. This method returns up to 100 resultsper page_number.
When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the filecontentand filepathfields when you pass thetext-matchmedia type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, seeText match metadata.
For example, if you want to find the definition of theaddClassfunction insidejQueryrepository, your query would look something like this:
q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery
This query searches for the keywordaddClasswithin a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in thejquery/jqueryrepository.
Considerations for code search:
Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
- Only thedefault branchis considered. In most cases, this will be themasterbranch.
- Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
- You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching forlanguage:gois not valid, whileamazing language:gois.

```
language:go
```

```
amazing language:go
```
This endpoint requires you to authenticate and limits you to 10 requests per minute.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Search code"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
- GitHub App installation access tokens
- Fine-grained personal access tokens
The fine-grained token does not require any permissions.
This endpoint can be used without authentication if only public resources are requested.

## Search commits
Find commits via various criteria on the default branch (usuallymain). This method returns up to 100 resultsper page_number.
When searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for themessagefield when you provide thetext-matchmedia type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, seeText match
metadata.
For example, if you want to find commits related to CSS in theoctocat/Spoon-Kniferepository. Your query would look something like this:
q=repo:octocat/Spoon-Knife+css

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Search commits"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
- GitHub App installation access tokens

## Search issues and pull requests
Find issues by issue_state and keyword. This method returns up to 100 resultsper page_number.
When searching for issues, you can get text match metadata for the issuetitle, issuebody, and issuecomment bodyfields when you pass thetext-matchmedia type. For more details about how to receive highlighted
search results, seeText match metadata.
For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this.
q=windows+label:bug+language:python+issue_state:open&sort=created&order=asc
This query searches for the keywordwindows, within any open issue that is labeled asbug. The search runs across repositories whose primary language is Python. The results are sorted by creation date in ascending order, which means the oldest issues appear first in the search results.
Note
For requests made by GitHub Apps with a user access token, you can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query. Requests that don't include theis:issueoris:pull-requestqualifier will receive an HTTP422 Unprocessable Entityresponse. To get results for both issues and pull requests, you must send separate queries for issues and pull requests. For more information about theisqualifier, see "Searching only issues or pull requests."
