# REST API endpoints for collaborators
Use the REST API to manage collaborators for a repository.

## List repository collaborators
For organization-owned repositories, the list of collaborators includes outside collaborators, organization members that are direct collaborators, organization members with access through team memberships, organization members with access through default organization permissions, and organization owners.
Thepermissionshash returned in the response contains the base role permissions of the collaborator. Therole_nameis the highest role assigned to the collaborator after considering all sources of grants, including: repo, teams, organization, and enterprise.
There is presently not a way to differentiate between an organization level grant and a repository level grant from this endpoint response.
Team members will include the members of child teams.
The authenticated user must have write, maintain, or admin privileges on the repository to use this endpoint. For organization-owned repositories, the authenticated user needs to be a member of the organization.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need theread:organdreposcopes to use this endpoint.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "List repository collaborators"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:
- GitHub App user access tokens
- GitHub App installation access tokens
- Fine-grained personal access tokens
The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:
- "Metadata" repository permissions (read)

Status: 204
```

## Add a repository collaborator
Add a user to a repository with a specified level of access. If the repository is owned by an organization, this API does not add the user to the organization - a user that has repository access without being an organization member is called an "outside collaborator" (if they are not an Enterprise Managed User) or a "repository collaborator" if they are an Enterprise Managed User. These users are exempt from some organization policies - see "Adding outside collaborators to repositories" to learn more about these collaborator types.
This endpoint triggersnotifications.
Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise and organization administrators. For more information, see "Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise" and "Setting permissions for adding outside collaborators" for organization settings.
For more information on permission levels, see "Repository permission levels for an organization". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the role being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:

```
Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
```

```
Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
```
Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to setContent-Lengthto zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "HTTP method."
The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page_number, the email they receive, or by using theAPI.
For Enterprise Managed Users, this endpoint does not send invitations - these users are automatically added to organizations and repositories. Enterprise Managed Users can only be added to organizations and repositories within their enterprise.
Updating an existing collaborator's permission level
The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a differentpermissionparameter. The response will be a204, with no other indication that the permission level changed.
Rate limits
You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Add a repository collaborator"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

## Remove a repository collaborator
Removes a collaborator from a repository.
To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an administrator of the repository or target themselves for removal.
This endpoint also:
- Cancels any outstanding invitations sent by the collaborator
- Unassigns the user from any issues
- Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization repositories.
- Unstars the repository
- Updates access permissions to packages
Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:
- If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
- If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
- If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.
Note
A user can still have access to the repository through organization permissions like base repository permissions.
Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates might take some extra time to complete in the background.
For more information on fork permissions, see "About permissions and visibility of forks".

### Fine-grained access tokens for "Remove a repository collaborator"

## Get repository permissions for a user
Checks the repository permission and role of a collaborator.
Thepermissionattribute provides the legacy base roles ofadmin,write,read, andnone, where themaintainrole is mapped towriteand thetriagerole is mapped toread.
Therole_nameattribute provides the name of the assigned role, including custom roles. Thepermissioncan also be used to determine which base level of access the collaborator has to the repository.
The calculated permissions are the highest role assigned to the collaborator after considering all sources of grants, including: repo, teams, organization, and enterprise.
There is presently not a way to differentiate between an organization level grant and a repository level grant from this endpoint response.
