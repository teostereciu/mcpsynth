# REST API endpoints for issues
Use the REST API to manage issues and pull requests.

## List issues assigned to the authenticated user
List issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member
repositories, and organization repositories. You can use thefilterquery parameter to fetch issues that are not
necessarily assigned to you.
Note
GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by thepull_requestkey. Be aware that theidof a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be anissue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."
- application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will includebody. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will includebody_text.
- application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will includebody_html.
- application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will includebody,body_text, andbody_html.

```
application/vnd.github.raw+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.text+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.html+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.full+json
```

## List organization issues assigned to the authenticated user
List issues in an organization assigned to the authenticated user.
Note
GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by thepull_requestkey. Be aware that theidof a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be anissue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."
- application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will includebody. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will includebody_text.
- application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will includebody_html.
- application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will includebody,body_text, andbody_html.

```
application/vnd.github.raw+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.text+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.html+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.full+json
```

## List repository issues
List issues in a repository. Only open issues will be listed.
Note
GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by thepull_requestkey. Be aware that theidof a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be anissue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."
- application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will includebody. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will includebody_text.
- application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will includebody_html.
- application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will includebody,body_text, andbody_html.

```
application/vnd.github.raw+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.text+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.html+json
```

```
application/vnd.github.full+json
```

You can identify pull requests by thepull_requestkey. Be aware that theidof a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be anissue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.
