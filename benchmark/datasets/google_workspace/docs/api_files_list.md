Lists the user's files. For more information, see [Search for files and folders](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/search-files).

This method accepts the `q` parameter, which is a search query combining one or more search terms.

This method returns *all* files by default, including trashed files. If you don't want trashed files to appear in the list, use the `trashed=false` query parameter to remove trashed files from the results.


### HTTP request


`GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files`


The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.


### Query parameters


| Parameters |
|---|
| corpora | string Specifies a collection of items (files or documents) to which the query applies. Supported items include: user domain drive allDrives Prefer user or drive to allDrives for efficiency. By default, corpora is set to user . However, this can change depending on the filter set through the q parameter. For more information, see File organization . |
| corpus (deprecated) | enum ( Corpus ) Deprecated: The source of files to list. Use corpora instead. |
| driveId | string ID of the shared drive to search. |
| includeItemsFromAllDrives | boolean Whether both My Drive and shared drive items should be included in results. |
| includeTeamDriveItems (deprecated) | boolean Deprecated: Use includeItemsFromAllDrives instead. |
| orderBy | string A comma-separated list of sort keys. Valid keys are: createdTime : When the file was created. Avoid using this key for queries on large item collections as it might result in timeouts or other issues. For time-related sorting on large item collections, use modifiedTime instead. folder : The folder ID. This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering. modifiedByMeTime : The last time the file was modified by the user. modifiedTime : The last time the file was modified by anyone. name : The name of the file. This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering, so 1, 12, 2, 22. name_natural : The name of the file. This field is sorted using natural sort ordering, so 1, 2, 12, 22. quotaBytesUsed : The number of storage quota bytes used by the file. recency : The most recent timestamp from the file's date-time fields. sharedWithMeTime : When the file was shared with the user, if applicable. starred : Whether the user has starred the file. viewedByMeTime : The last time the file was viewed by the user. Each key sorts ascending by default, but can be reversed with the desc modifier. Example usage: ?orderBy=folder,modifiedTime desc,name . |
| pageSize | integer The maximum number of files to return per page. Partial or empty result pages are possible even before the end of the files list has been reached. |
| pageToken | string The token for continuing a previous list request on the next page. This should be set to the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. |
| q | string A query for filtering the file results. For supported syntax, see Search for files and folders . |
| spaces | string A comma-separated list of spaces to query within the corpora. Supported values are drive and appDataFolder . For more information, see File organization . |
| supportsAllDrives | boolean Whether the requesting application supports both My Drives and shared drives. |
| supportsTeamDrives (deprecated) | boolean Deprecated: Use supportsAllDrives instead. |
| teamDriveId (deprecated) | string Deprecated: Use driveId instead. |
| includePermissionsForView | string Specifies which additional view's permissions to include in the response. Only published is supported. |
| includeLabels | string A comma-separated list of IDs of labels to include in the labelInfo part of the response. |


### Request body


The request body must be empty.


### Response body


A list of files.


If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:


| JSON representation |
|---|
| { "files" : [ { object ( File ) } ] , "nextPageToken" : string , "kind" : string , "incompleteSearch" : boolean } |


| Fields |
|---|
| files[] | object ( File ) The list of files. If nextPageToken is populated, then this list may be incomplete and an additional page of results should be fetched. |
| nextPageToken | string The page token for the next page of files. This will be absent if the end of the files list has been reached. If the token is rejected for any reason, it should be discarded, and pagination should be restarted from the first page of results. The page token is typically valid for several hours. However, if new items are added or removed, your expected results might differ. |
| kind | string Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "drive#fileList" . |
| incompleteSearch | boolean Whether the search process was incomplete. If true, then some search results might be missing, since all documents were not searched. This can occur when searching multiple drives with the allDrives corpora, but all corpora couldn't be searched. When this happens, it's suggested that clients narrow their query by choosing a different corpus such as user or drive . |


### Authorization scopes
