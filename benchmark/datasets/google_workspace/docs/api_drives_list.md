Lists the user's shared drives.

### HTTP request


`GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/drives`


The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.


### Query parameters


| Parameters |
|---|
| pageSize | integer Maximum number of shared drives to return per page. |
| pageToken | string Page token for shared drives. |
| q | string Query string for searching shared drives. |
| useDomainAdminAccess | boolean Issue the request as a domain administrator; if set to true, then all shared drives of the domain in which the requester is an administrator are returned. |


### Request body


The request body must be empty.


### Response body


A list of shared drives.


If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:


| JSON representation |
|---|
| { "drives" : [ { object ( Drive ) } ] , "nextPageToken" : string , "kind" : string } |


| Fields |
|---|
| drives[] | object ( Drive ) The list of shared drives. If nextPageToken is populated, then this list may be incomplete and an additional page of results should be fetched. |
| nextPageToken | string The page token for the next page of shared drives. This will be absent if the end of the list has been reached. If the token is rejected for any reason, it should be discarded, and pagination should be restarted from the first page of results. The page token is typically valid for several hours. However, if new items are added or removed, your expected results might differ. |
| kind | string Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "drive#driveList" . |


### Authorization scopes


Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:


- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
- `
          https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`


Some scopes are restricted and require a security assessment for your app to use them. For more information, see the [Authorization guide](/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent).
