A list of permissions for a file.


If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:


| JSON representation |
|---|
| { "permissions" : [ { object ( Permission ) } ] , "nextPageToken" : string , "kind" : string } |


| Fields |
|---|
| permissions[] | object ( Permission ) The list of permissions. If nextPageToken is populated, then this list may be incomplete and an additional page of results should be fetched. |
| nextPageToken | string The page token for the next page of permissions. This field will be absent if the end of the permissions list has been reached. If the token is rejected for any reason, it should be discarded, and pagination should be restarted from the first page of results. The page token is typically valid for several hours. However, if new items are added or removed, your expected results might differ. |
