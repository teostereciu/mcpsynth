        }


The [file object](/reference/objects/file-object) contains information about the uploaded file.

Only the original creator of the file can use the `files.sharedPublicURL` method unless the file is shared into a public channel.

Each comment object in the comments array contains details about a single comment. Comments are returned oldest first.

The paging information contains the `count` of comments returned, the `total` number of comments, the `page` of results returned in this response and the total number of `pages` available. Please note that the max `count` value is `1000` and the max `page` value is `100`.

Error

Description

`access_denied`

Access to a resource specified in the request is denied.

`accesslimited`

Access to this method is limited on the current network

`account_inactive`

Authentication token is for a deleted user or workspace when using a `bot` token.

`deprecated_endpoint`

`ekm_access_denied`

Administrators have suspended the ability to post a message.

`enterprise_is_restricted`

Value passed for `file` was invalid

`internal_error`

The server could not complete your operation(s) without encountering an error, likely due to a transient issue on our end. It's possible some aspect of the operation succeeded before the error was raised.

`invalid_arg_name`

The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of accepted or expected values. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than `_`. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a _very_ malformed API call.

`invalid_arguments`

The method was called with invalid arguments.

`invalid_array_arg`

The method was passed an array as an argument. Please only input valid strings.

`invalid_auth`

Some aspect of authentication cannot be validated. Either the provided token is invalid or the request originates from an IP address disallowed from making the request.

`invalid_charset`

The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `charset` specified in the `Content-Type` header was invalid. Valid charset names are: `utf-8` `iso-8859-1`.

`invalid_form_data`

The method was called via a `POST` request with `Content-Type` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, but the form data was either missing or syntactically invalid.

`invalid_post_type`

The method was called via a `POST` request, but the specified `Content-Type` was invalid. Valid types are: `application/json` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `multipart/form-data` `text/plain`.

`no_permission`

The workspace token used in this request does not have the permissions necessary to complete the request. Make sure your app is a member of the conversation it's attempting to post a message to.

`not_allowed`

Public sharing has been disabled for this team. You may see this error if you are creating an external link from a free or trial workspace. You can either upgrade to a [Paid Plan](https://app.slack.com/plans) or use `file.list` to get a `url_private_download` link, download the file with an application, and re-upload it somewhere it can be shared with users who are not members of your workspace. Be sure to pass the Slack [Bot token](/authentication/tokens#bot) to the request on the headers file when calling `url_private_download`.

`not_allowed_token_type`

The token type used in this request is not allowed.

`not_authed`

No authentication token provided.

The workspace is undergoing an enterprise migration and will not be available until migration is complete.

`public_file_type_not_allowed`
