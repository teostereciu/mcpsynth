## Usage info​

This method adds a remote file to Slack. Adding a file does not share it to a channel. To make your remote file visible, use the [`files.remote.share`](/reference/methods/files.remote.share) API method. This method performs an upsert: if you add a file that has been added previously, the existing file will be updated.

Remote files exist across the entire workspace (or organization, for Enterprise orgs). Because of that, remote files must be added by bots with the [`bot` scope](/reference/scopes/bot), not by an individual user. Dimension requirements for previews are a minimum of `800w x 400h`.

`preview_image` is displayed when your remote file is [shared](/reference/methods/files.remote.share). It's a binary image file.

`external_id` is the unique ID of the remote file, according to the external host of the file.

`indexable_file_contents` is a text file that represents the file for search. When a user searches in Slack, their query will be compared against the contents of this text file for matching. Think of this text file like the `alt` parameter on an HTML `<img>` tag: a textual representation of a non-textual object. The text file can contain a description of the remote file, or it can contain search keywords or anything else text-based.

One tricky bit: in the response, the file object may indicate that `"has_rich_preview"` is `false`, even if you include the `preview_image` parameter. That's because it takes a few seconds for Slack to parse the `preview_image` you pass. If you call `files.remote.add` with the same `external_id` later, you'll see `"has_preview_image": true`.
