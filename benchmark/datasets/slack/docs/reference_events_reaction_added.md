    {
        "token": "XXYYZZ",
        "team_id": "T123ABC456",
        "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
        "event": {
            "type": "reaction_added",
            "user": "U123ABC456",
            "reaction": "thumbsup",
            "item_user": "U222222222",
            "item": {
                "type": "message",
                "channel": "C123ABC456",
                "ts": "1360782400.498405"
            },
            "event_ts": "1360782804.083113"
        },

            {
                "team_id": "T123ABC456",
                "user_id": "U123ABC456",
                "is_bot": false,
                "is_enterprise_install": false,
            }
        ],

        "event_time": 123456789
    }


When a reaction is added to an item the `reaction_added` event is sent to all connected clients for users who can see the content that was reacted to.

The `user` field indicates the ID of the user who performed this event. The `item_user` field represents the ID of the user that created the original item that has been reacted to.

Some messages aren't authored by "users," like those created by [incoming webhooks](/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks). `reaction_added` events related to these messages will not include an `item_user`.

The `item` field is a brief reference to what was reacted to. The above example describes a reaction to a message.

### Embedded item objects​

Embedded `item` nodes are more lightweight than the structures you'll find in [`reactions.list`](/reference/methods/reactions.list).

Here are some examples:

#### Message:​


    "item": {
        "type": "message",
        "channel": "C123ABC456",
        "ts": "1360782400.498405"
    }


#### File:​


    "item": {
        "type": "file",
        "file": "F123ABC456"
    }


#### File Comment:​


    "item": {
        "type": "file_comment",
        "file_comment": "Fc123ABC456",
        "file": "F123ABC456"
    }
