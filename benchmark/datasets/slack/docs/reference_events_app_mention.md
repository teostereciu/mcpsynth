## Usage info​

This example includes both the [event wrapper](/apis/events-api/#callback-field) and the [event structure](/apis/events-api/#event-type-structure) for the `app_mention` event.


    {
        "token": "XXYYZZ",
        "team_id": "T123ABC456",
        "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
        "event": {
            "type": "app_mention",
            "user": "U061F7AUR",
            "text": "<@U0LAN0Z89> is it everything a river should be?",
            "ts": "1515449522.000016",
            "channel": "C123ABC456",
            "event_ts": "1515449522000016"
        },
        "type": "event_callback",
        "authorizations": [
            {
                "team_id": "T123ABC456",
                "user_id": "U123ABC456",
                "is_bot": false,
                "is_enterprise_install": false,
            }
        ],
        "event_id": "Ev123ABC456",
        "event_time": 123456789
    }


This [app event](/apis/events-api/#app_events) allows your app to subscribe to [`message`](/reference/events/message) events that directly mention your bot users.

Your Slack app must have a bot user configured and installed to use this event.

If a user mentions your app in a conversation that your app isn't party to, the user has the option to invite your app to the conversation. In that case, you'll receive an `app_mention` event for the invite.

You'll receive _only_ the messages pertinent to your app with this event. If your app is mentioned but not part of a conversation (and not invited to join), you won't receive an event.

The `app_mention` event is not a [`message`](/reference/events/message) like the `message.*` event types. However, your app can treat its contents similarly.

Messages sent to your app in _direct message_ conversations are **not** dispatched via `app_mention`, including messages sent from other apps, regardless of whether your app is explicitly mentioned or otherwise. Subscribe to [`message.im`](/reference/events/message.im) events to receive messages directed to your bot user in direct message conversations.

## Example event payloads​

`app_mention` events are just like other `message` events sent over the Events API, but their `type` indicates `app_mention`.

Whether your app has just been invited to a channel _or_ is receiving a mention after it's already in a channel, the format and shape is the same.

Read on for more detail on the two scenarios with full Events API envelopes.

  * App mention that invites your app to a channel
  * App mention when your app is already in channel


### App mention that invites your app to a channel​

When your app is directly invited to a channel as a result of being mentioned, you'll receive that inciting message as an `app_mention`:


    {
        "token": "ZZZZZZWSxiZZZ2yIvs3peJ",
        "team_id": "T061EG9R6",
        "api_app_id": "A0MDYCDME",
        "event": {
            "type": "app_mention",
            "user": "U0123ABCD",
            "text": "You can count on <@U0LAN0Z89> for an honorable mention.",
            "ts": "1515449483.000108",
            "channel": "C123ABC456",
            "event_ts": "1515449483000108"
        },
        "type": "event_callback",
        "event_id": "Ev0MDYHUEL",
        "event_time": 1515449483000108,
        "authorizations": [
            {
                "user_id": "U0123ABCD",
                "is_bot": false,
                "is_enterprise_install": false,
            }
        ],
    }


You'll need to monitor your app's channel membership separately from this event. Consider subscribing to [`member_joined_channel`](/reference/events/member_joined_channel) events too.

### Standard app mention when your app is already in channel​

Here's the happiest path: you're already part of a conversation and your app is mentioned. It can respond freely after receiving an event like this:


    {
        "token": "ZZZZZZWSxiZZZ2yIvs3peJ",
        "team_id": "T123ABC456",
        "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
        "event": {
            "type": "app_mention",
            "user": "U123ABC456",
            "text": "What is the hour of the pearl, <@U0LAN0Z89>?",
            "ts": "1515449522.000016",
            "channel": "C123ABC456",
            "event_ts": "1515449522000016"
        },
        "type": "event_callback",
        "event_id": "Ev123ABC456",
        "event_time": 1515449522000016,
        "authorizations": [
            {
                "team_id": "T123ABC456",
                "user_id": "U123ABC456",
                "is_bot": false,
                "is_enterprise_install": false,
            }
        ],
    }
