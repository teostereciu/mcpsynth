# Modifying messages

*Source: https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/modifying-messages*

---

A message captures a specific moment in time. But if you're an app, you might want to publish messages that communicate something that changes over time. Perhaps its the progress of a long running database request, or maybe just a message asking a user to wait for the response of an external API request.

In these cases and others, it's useful to have a way to modify messages from their original form. Slack apps are able to update and delete messages via APIs.

## Updating messages​

Any non-[ephemeral](/messaging#ephemeral) message may possibly be updated by an app, by using the [`chat.update`](/reference/methods/chat.update) method.

The process for using this API is largely the same as that for [sending messages](/messaging/sending-and-scheduling-messages), but there are a few small differences:

  * You can't _move_ a message, so the `channel` parameter is used as an identifier for the target message to update, not as a way to update the conversation a message is in.
  * Ephemeral messages can't be updated in this way.
  * An app can't just update every message in a conversation - only ones posted by the authenticated user of the token being used, including those posted _as the app_. The same applies to bot users, where you use a bot user token. [Read the API reference for more information](/reference/methods/chat.update#valid_message_types).


### Updating messages using `response_url`​

When a user interacts with an [interactive element in a message](/messaging/creating-interactive-messages#interaction), [a payload containing a `response_url` will be sent](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads) to the app that published the interactive message.

This `response_url` can be used to [publish new messages](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#message_responses). It can also be used to **update** the original interactive message, regardless of whether it was an [ephemeral message](/messaging#ephemeral) or not.

Read [our interactive messages guide](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#updating_message_response) for more details on how to update messages using `response_url`.

## Deleting messages​

The [`chat.delete`](/reference/methods/chat.delete) API method offers apps the powerful ability to delete messages, using the [same permissions as those used to send messages](/messaging/sending-and-scheduling-messages#permissions):

  * HTTP
  * Java
  * JavaScript
  * Python

                            .channel(item.getChannel())
                            .ts(item.getTs())
                        );
                        logger.info("result: {}", result);
                    }
                } catch (IOException | SlackApiException e) {
                    logger.error("error: {}", e.getMessage(), e);
                }
                return ctx.ack();
            });

            var server = new SlackAppServer(app);
            server.start();

    // Require the Node Slack SDK package (github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk)
    const { WebClient, LogLevel } = require("@slack/web-api");

        )
        logger.info(result)

    except SlackApiError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error deleting message: {e}")


The right for an app to delete a message depends on a few caveats:

  * If using a standard user's [user token](/authentication/tokens#user), only messages posted by that user, or those posted as the app, may be deleted.
  * If using a Workspace Admin user's [user token](/authentication/tokens#user), most messages in that workspace can be deleted.
  * If using a [bot user token](/authentication/tokens#bot), only messages posted by that bot user, or those posted as the app, may be deleted.
  * Ephemeral messages can't be deleted in this way.


If the message has some [threaded replies](/messaging#threading), then those replies will be left in the conversation, with a placeholder informing viewers about the deleted message:

### Deleting messages using `response_url`​

When a user interacts with an [interactive element in a message](/messaging/creating-interactive-messages#interaction), [a payload containing a `response_url` will be sent](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads) to the app that published the interactive message.

This `response_url` can be used to [publish new messages in response](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#message_responses). It can also be used to **delete** the original interactive message, regardless of whether it was an [ephemeral message](/messaging#ephemeral) or not.

Read [our interactive messages guide for more details on how to delete messages using `response_url`](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#deleting_message_response).
