Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`channel`**`string`Required

Channel or conversation to set the read cursor for.

_Example:_`C012345678`

## Usage info​

This method moves the read cursor in a conversation for whomever owns the token used in the request. We don't know why bot users would want to move their read cursor but it can be done.

The associated user must be a member of the channel.

## Response​

####

    {

    }


After making this call, the mark is saved to the database and broadcast via the message server to all open connections for the calling user.

Don't make calls to this method very often. When needing to mark a read position, a client should set a timer before making the call. In this way, any further updates needed during the timeout will not generate extra calls (just one per channel). This is useful for when reading scroll-back history, or following a busy live channel. A timeout of 5 seconds is a good starting point.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
