## Usage Info​

_Interactive component_ \- see our [guide to enabling interactivity](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction).

On desktop clients, the time picker will take the form of a dropdown list and the date picker will take the form of a dropdown calendar. Both options will have free-text entry for precise choices. On mobile clients, the time picker and date picker will use native UIs.

## Example​

The datetime picker element must be used inside the [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows an input block containing a datetime picker element:


    {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "input",
                "element": {
                    "type": "datetimepicker",
                    "action_id": "datetimepicker-action"
                },
                "hint": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "This is some hint text",
                    "emoji": true
                },
                "label": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Start date",
                    "emoji": true
                }
            }
        ]
    }
