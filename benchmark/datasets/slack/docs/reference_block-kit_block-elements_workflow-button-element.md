Example:

## Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `workflow_button`.| Required| `text`| Object| A [text object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object) that defines the button's text. Can only be of `type: plain_text`. `text` may truncate with ~30 characters. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 75 characters.| Required| `workflow`| Object| A [workflow object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/workflow-object) that contains details about the workflow that will run when the button is clicked.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action. Use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Every `action_id` in a block should be unique. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Required| `style`| String| Decorates buttons with alternative visual color schemes. Use this option with restraint.`primary` gives buttons a green outline and text, ideal for affirmation or confirmation actions. `primary` should only be used for one button within a set.`danger` gives buttons a red outline and text, and should be used when the action is destructive. Use `danger` even more sparingly than `primary`.If you don't include this field, the default button style will be used.| Optional| `accessibility_label`| String| A label for longer descriptive text about a button element. This label will be read out by screen readers _instead of_ the button [`text` object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object). Maximum length is 75 characters.| Optional
