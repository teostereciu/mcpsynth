    {
        "token": "XXYYZZ",
        "team_id": "T123ABC456",
        "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
        "event": {
            "type": "app_uninstalled"
        },
        "type": "event_callback",
        "authorizations": [
            {
                "team_id": "T123ABC456",
                "user_id": "U123ABC456",
                "is_bot": false,
                "is_enterprise_install": false,
            }
        ],
        "event_id": "Ev123ABC456",
        "event_time": 123456789
    }


This Events API-only event is sent via subscription whenever a Slack app is **completely** uninstalled.

You should also receive [`tokens_revoked`](/reference/events/tokens_revoked) events for revoked tokens however the order of the `app_uninstalled` and `tokens_revoked` events are not guaranteed to be sequential (you could receive a `tokens_revoked` event after `app_uninstalled`). An app is not uninstalled until its final user and bot tokens are revoked.

The example above details the complete Events API payload, including the event wrapper. The `team_id` indicates which workspace uninstalled the Slack app identified by `api_app_id`.
