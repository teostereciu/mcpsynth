## Usage info​

This example includes both the [event wrapper](/apis/events-api/#callback-field) and the [event structure](/apis/events-api/#event-type-structure) for the `tokens_revoked` event.


    {
        "token": "XXYYZZ",
        "team_id": "TXXXXXXXX",
        "api_app_id": "AXXXXXXXXX",
        "event": {
            "type": "tokens_revoked",
            "tokens": {
                "oauth": [
                    "UXXXXXXXX"
                ],
                "bot": [
                    "UXXXXXXXX"
                ]
            }
        },
        "type": "event_callback",
        "event_id": "EvXXXXXXXX",
        "event_time": 1234567890
    }


When your app's API tokens are revoked, the `tokens_revoked` event is sent via the Events API to your app if it is subscribed.

The example above details the complete Events API payload, including the event wrapper. Use the `team_id` to identify the associated workspace.

The inner event's `tokens` field is a hash keyed with the types of revoked tokens. `oauth` tokens are user-based tokens negotiated with [OAuth](/authentication) or app installation, typically beginning with `xoxp-`. `bot` tokens are also negotiated in that process, but belong specifically to any bot users contained in your app and begin with `xoxb-`. Each key contains an array of user IDs, _not_ the actual `token` strings representing your revoked tokens. To use this event most effectively, store your tokens along side user IDs and team IDs.
