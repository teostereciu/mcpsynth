# Option

*Source: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object*

---

**Defines a single item in a number of item selection elements.**

An object that represents a single selectable item in a [select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/select-menu-element), [multi-select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/multi-select-menu-element), [checkbox group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/checkboxes-element), [radio button group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/radio-button-group-element), or [overflow menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/overflow-menu-element).

#### Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `text`| Object| A text object that defines the text shown in the option on the menu. Overflow, select, and multi-select menus can only use `plain_text` objects, while radio buttons and checkboxes can use `mrkdwn` text objects. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 75 characters.| Required| `value`| String| A unique string value that will be passed to your app when this option is chosen. Maximum length for this field is 150 characters.| Required| `description`| Object| A `plain_text` text object that defines a line of descriptive text shown below the `text` field beside a single selectable item in a [select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/select-menu-element), [multi-select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/multi-select-menu-element), [checkbox group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/checkboxes-element), [radio button group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/radio-button-group-element), or [overflow menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/overflow-menu-element). [Checkbox group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/checkboxes-element) and [radio button group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/radio-button-group-element) items can also use [`mrkdwn`](/messaging/formatting-message-text#basic-formatting) formatting. Maximum length for the `text` within this field is 75 characters.| Optional| `url`| String| A URL to load in the user's browser when the option is clicked. **The`url` attribute is only available in [overflow menus](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/overflow-menu-element)**. Maximum length for this field is 3000 characters. If you're using `url`, you'll still receive an [interaction payload](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads) and will need to [send an acknowledgement response](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#acknowledgment_response).| Optional

#### Example​


    {
        "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "emoji": true,
            "text": "Save it"
        },
        "value": "value-2"
    }


The option object must be used with the [select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/select-menu-element), [multi-select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/multi-select-menu-element), [checkbox group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/checkboxes-element), [radio button group](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/radio-button-group-element), or [overflow menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/overflow-menu-element).

This example shows a section block containing a static select menu element with several option objects.
