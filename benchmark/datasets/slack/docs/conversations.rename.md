## Usage info​

This method renames a conversation. Some types of conversations cannot be renamed.

Only the user that originally created a channel, a Workspace Admin, or a user with the Channel Manager role may rename it. Others will receive a `not_authorized` error.

## Naming​

Conversation names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and must be 80 characters or less. We will validate the submitted channel name and modify it to meet the above criteria. When calling this method, we recommend storing the channel's `name` value that is returned in the response.
