## Usage info​

This method deletes a pending scheduled message before it is sent.

There are two ways to determine the `scheduled_message_id` of a message you wish to delete:

  * The response of the [`chat.scheduleMessage`](/reference/methods/chat.scheduleMessage) endpoint contains the `scheduled_message_id` needed to delete that message.
  * You can also retrieve the `scheduled_message_id`s for all the messages you've scheduled by calling [`chat.scheduledMessages.list`](/reference/methods/chat.scheduledMessages.list).


## Restrictions​

You cannot delete scheduled messages that have already been posted to Slack _or_ that will be posted to Slack within 60 seconds of the delete request. If attempted, this method will respond with an `invalid_scheduled_message_id` error.
