## Arguments​

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`channel`**`string`Required

The ID of the public or private channel to invite user(s) to.

**`users`**`string`Required

A comma separated list of user IDs. Up to 100 users may be listed.

## Usage info​

This [Conversations API](/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api) method invites 1-1000 users to a public or private channel. The calling user must be a member of the channel.

### Partially failed calls​

Users who can be successfully invited and who were not members of the workspace previously will not be invited if _any_ of the user invites fail. Instead, an error response will be returned.

Inviting users who are in a "removed" state (that is, they were once a member of the workspace but have since been removed) will fail “silently”: an error response will be returned via the API, but all other users will be invited except for those in the "removed" state.

####

Error response when users cannot be invited for differing reasons: one for not being associated with a valid user ID, and one for being the user sending the invite.


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "user_not_found",
      "errors": [
        {
          "user": "U111111",
          "ok": false,
          "error": "user_not_found"
        },
        {

          "ok": false,
          "error": "cant_invite_self"

      ]
    }
