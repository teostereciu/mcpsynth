## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`channel`**`string`Required

Channel containing the message to be deleted.

**`ts`**`string`Required

Timestamp of the message to be deleted.

_Example:_`"1405894322.002768"`

### Optional arguments

**`as_user`**`boolean`Optional

(Legacy) Pass true to delete the message as the authed user with `chat:write:user` scope. Bot users in this context are considered authed users. See legacy `as_user` parameter below.

_Example:_`true`

## Usage info​

This method deletes a message from a conversation.

When used with a user token, this method may only [delete messages that user themselves can delete in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/help/articles/202395258-Edit-or-delete-messages).

When used with a bot token, this method may delete only messages posted by that bot.

This method has no accommodations for impersonation. If a message is sent impersonating another user, you will not be able to call `chat.delete` to delete that same message.

## Legacy concerns​

Information in the section below applies only to classic apps.

This feature works differently for classic apps.

### Legacy authorship​

Classic apps using the umbrella `bot` scope can't request additional scopes to adjust message authorship.

#### Legacy `as_user` parameter​

For classic apps, the best way to control the authorship of a message was to be explicit with the legacy `as_user` parameter. If you didn't use the `as_user` parameter, `chat.delete` would guess the most appropriate `as_user` interpretation based on the kind of token you were using. If `as_user` was not provided at all, the value was inferred based on the scopes granted to the caller: If the caller _could_ delete with `as_user` passed as `false`, then that was how the method behaved; otherwise, the method behaved as if `as_user` were passed as `true`. When the `as_user` parameter was set to `false`, messages were deleted as "[`bot_messages`](/reference/events/message/bot_message)", with message authorship attributed to the user name and icons associated with the classic app.

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
