## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`channel`**`string`Required

Channel where the message to add reaction to was posted.

**`name`**`string`Required

Reaction (emoji) name

 _Example:_`thumbsup`

**`timestamp`**`string`Required

Timestamp of the message to add reaction to.

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

## Usage info​

This method adds a reaction (emoji) to a message. Now that [file threads](/changelog/2018-05-file-threads-soon-tread#whats_changed) work the way you'd expect, the `file` and `file_comment` arguments are deprecated. Specify only `channel` and `timestamp` instead.

For Unicode emoji that support [skin tone modifiers](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-modifier-sequence/), `name` may indicate a modifier by appending `::skin-tone-` and a number from 2 to 6, like, `thumbsup::skin-tone-6` or `wave::skin-tone-3`. This will add a reaction with the base emoji and the specified skin color.

## Response​

####

Typical success response


    {
      "ok": true
    }


####

Typical error response


    {
      "error": "already_reacted",
      "ok": false
    }


After making this call, the reaction is saved and [a `reaction_added` event](/reference/events/reaction_added) is broadcast via the [Events](/apis/events-api/) and [RTM](/legacy/legacy-rtm-api) APIs.

A `not_reactable` error is thrown when we decline the opportunity to attach your app's personally selected emoji reaction to a file or file comment. It's not because of how your app feels, it's because that approach is retired. Your app can express its inner reacji for any message though, by specifying `channel` and `timestamp`.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
