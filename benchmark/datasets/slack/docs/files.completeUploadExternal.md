## Usage info​

This method finalizes a file upload started with [`files.getUploadURLExternal`](/reference/methods/files.getUploadURLExternal).

After uploading the file to the URL obtained from [`files.getUploadURLExternal`](/reference/methods/files.getUploadURLExternal), call this endpoint to share the uploaded file in Slack. In most cases, callers will supply a channel where the file will be shared. If the `channel_id` is not specified, the file will remain private.

If this method is not called, the uploaded file and associated metadata will be discarded.

This method can only be called once.
