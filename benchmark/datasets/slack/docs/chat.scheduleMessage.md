## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`channel`**`string`Required

Channel, private group, or DM channel to send message to. Can be an encoded ID, or a name. See below for more details.

**`post_at`**`integer`Required

Unix timestamp representing the future time the message should post to Slack.

_Example:_`299876400`

### Optional arguments

**`as_user`**`boolean`Optional

Set to `true` to post the message as the authed user, instead of as a bot. Defaults to false. Cannot be used by [new Slack apps](/quickstart). See [chat.postMessage](chat.postMessage#authorship).

_Example:_`true`

**`attachments`**`string`Optional

A JSON-based array of structured attachments, presented as a URL-encoded string.

_Example:_`[{"pretext": "pre-hello", "text": "text-world"}]`

**`blocks`**`string`Optional

A JSON-based array of structured blocks, presented as a URL-encoded string.

_Example:_`[{"type": "section", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Hello world"}}]`

**`link_names`**`boolean`Optional

Find and link user groups. No longer supports linking individual users; use syntax shown in [Mentioning Users](/messaging/formatting-message-text#mentioning-users) instead.

_Example:_`true`

**`markdown_text`**`string`Optional

Accepts message text formatted in markdown. This argument should not be used in conjunction with `blocks` or `text`. Limit this field to 12,000 characters.

_Example:_`**This is bold text**`

 **`parse`**`string`Optional

Change how messages are treated. See [chat.postMessage](chat.postMessage#formatting).

_Acceptable values:_`none` `full`

 _Example:_`full`

**`reply_broadcast`**`boolean`Optional

Used in conjunction with `thread_ts` and indicates whether reply should be made visible to everyone in the channel or conversation. Defaults to `false`.

_Example:_`true`

**`text`**`string`Optional

How this field works and whether it is required depends on other fields you use in your API call. See below for more detail.

_Example:_`Hello world`

**`thread_ts`**`string`Optional

Provide another message's `ts` value to make this message a reply. Avoid using a reply's `ts` value; use its parent instead.

**`unfurl_links`**`boolean`Optional

Pass true to enable unfurling of primarily text-based content.

_Example:_`true`

**`unfurl_media`**`boolean`Optional

Pass false to disable unfurling of media content.

_Example:_`false`

**`metadata`** Optional

JSON object with event_type and event_payload fields, presented as a URL-encoded string. Metadata you post to Slack is accessible to any app or user who is a member of that workspace.

_Example:_`{"event_type": "task_created", "event_payload": { "id": "11223", "title": "Redesign Homepage"}}`

## Usage info​

Bug alert

Messages scheduled with `chat.scheduleMessage` will not post if the `metadata` parameter is used.

This method schedules a [message](/messaging) for delivery to a public channel, private channel, or direct message (DM) conversation at a specified time in the future. Messages scheduled through this method can be seen by calling the [`chat.scheduledMessages.list`](/reference/methods/chat.scheduledMessages.list) API method.

## The `text`, `blocks` and `attachments` fields​

The usage of the `text` field changes depending on whether you're using `blocks`. If you're using `blocks`, this is used as a fallback string to display in notifications. If you aren't, this is the main body text of the message. It can be formatted as plain text, or with `mrkdwn`.

## Restrictions​

You will only be able to schedule a message up to 120 days into the future. If you specify a `post_at` timestamp beyond this limit, you’ll receive a `time_too_far` error response. Additionally, you cannot schedule more than 30 messages to post within a 5-minute window to the same channel. Exceeding this will result in a `restricted_too_many` error.

## Response​

####

Typical success response


    {
      "ok": true,
      "channel": "C123ABC456",
      "scheduled_message_id": "Q1298393284",
      "post_at": "1562180400",
      "message": {
        "text": "Here's a message for you in the future",
        "username": "ecto1",
        "bot_id": "B123ABC456",
        "attachments": [
          {
            "text": "This is an attachment",
            "id": 1,
            "fallback": "This is an attachment's fallback"
          }
        ],
        "type": "delayed_message",
        "subtype": "bot_message"
      }
    }


####

Typical error response if the `post_at` is invalid (ex. in the past or too far into the future)


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "time_in_past"
    }


The response includes the `scheduled_message_id` assigned to your message. Use it with the [`chat.deleteScheduledMessage`](/reference/methods/chat.deleteScheduledMessage) API method to delete the message before it is sent.

For details on formatting, usage in threads, and rate limiting, refer to the [`chat.postMessage`](/reference/methods/chat.postMessage) API method documentation.

## Channels​

You **must** specify a public channel, private channel, or DM conversation with the `channel` argument. Each one behaves slightly differently based on the authenticated user's permissions and additional arguments:

#### Post to a channel​

You can either pass the channel's name (`#general`) or the encoded ID (`C123ABC456`) and the message will be posted to that channel. The channel's ID can be retrieved through the [`conversations.list`](/reference/methods/conversations.list) API method.

#### Post to a DM​

Pass the DM conversation's channel ID (`D123ABC456`) or a user's ID (`U123ABC456`) as the value of `channel` to post to that DM conversation.

The DM conversation's channel ID can be retrieved by calling the [`conversations.list`](/reference/methods/conversations.list) API method. Use the `types` parameters to return only `im` conversations. You may receive a `channel_not_found` error if your app doesn't have permission to enter into an direct message with the intended user.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
