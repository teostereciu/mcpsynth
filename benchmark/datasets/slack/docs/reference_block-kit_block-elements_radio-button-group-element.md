## Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `radio_buttons`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action triggered when the radio button group is changed. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Optional| `options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object). A maximum of 10 options are allowed.| Required| `initial_option`| Object| An [option object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object) that exactly matches one of the options within `options`. This option will be selected when the radio button group initially loads.| Optional| `confirm`| Object| A [confirm object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears after clicking one of the radio buttons in this element.| Optional| `focus_on_load`| Boolean| Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](/reference/views).

## Example​

The radio button group element must be used inside of the [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a set of radio buttons:


    {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "section",
                "text": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Check out these rad radio buttons"
                },
                "accessory": {
                    "type": "radio_buttons",
                    "action_id": "this_is_an_action_id",
                    "initial_option": {
                        "value": "A1",
                        "text": {
                            "type": "plain_text",
                            "text": "Radio 1"
                        }
                    },
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "value": "A1",
                            "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "Radio 1"
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "value": "A2",
                            "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "Radio 2"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
