Comma-separated list of channel IDs where the file will be shared.

### Optional arguments

## Usage info​

This method shares a remote file in a Slack conversation.

If you add a remote file without also sharing the file, it exists as an orphan within Slack: i.e., you can view information about the file using the [`files.remote.info`](/reference/methods/files.remote.info) API method, but the file itself won't be visible anywhere within Slack.
