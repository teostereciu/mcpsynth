## Usage info​

Canvases are only available to Slack workspaces on a paid plan.

The `canvases.access.delete` method removes the access level to a canvas for specified entities. Similar to the [`canvases.access.set`](/reference/methods/canvases.access.set) method, you can only remove access levels for regular channels. Channel IDs associated with direct messages (DMs) and multi-party direct messages (MPDMs) will not be accepted and will result in an unsuccessful request.

If you share a canvas in a channel and grant write access to the channel members, later attempting to remove a specific user's access by passing their user ID to this method will **not** work. Permissions are set at the channel level, so to remove a user's access, you must update the channel permissions for all members.
