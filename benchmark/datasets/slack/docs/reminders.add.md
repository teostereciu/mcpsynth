## Usage info​

Retirement of API methods for interfacing with reminders began March 2023, and as such have become degraded or useless.

See [this changelog](/changelog/2023-07-its-later-already-for-stars-and-reminders) for more information.

This method creates a reminder.

Setting reminders for other users with `reminders.add` can now only be done with a bot token. As an alternative, you can use apps created with the [Deno Slack SDK](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/) to add reminders via [scheduled triggers](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/creating-scheduled-triggers).
