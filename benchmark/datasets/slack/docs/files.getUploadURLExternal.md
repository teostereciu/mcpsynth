## Usage info​

This method gets a URL that can be used for uploading a file to share within channels. The URL allows clients to send file data to Slack's file upload service.

The workflow is as follows:

  1. Call `files.getUploadURLExternal`, which returns an upload URL and a file ID.
  2. Upload a file by making a POST request to the upload URL. Include the filename (e.g., `-F filename="@text.txt"`). Files are processed asynchronously via a job handler.
     * Files can be sent as raw bytes or can be multipart form encoded. Slack will return HTTP 200 if the upload is successful; a non-200 response indicates a failure.
  3. Call [`files.completeUploadExternal`](/reference/methods/files.completeUploadExternal) to finalize the upload.
     * There is no need to wait for files to be processed by the job handler; the `files.completeUploadExternal` method will return with no action until both processes have completed. If `files.completeUploadExternal` is not called, the upload will be aborted and clients will receive an error.
