## Usage info​

Once you have your OAuth2 provider configured, you can use this API method to retrieve the token needed to access your external service by its token ID.

The following example code snippet is from a custom function defined within the [Deno simple survey sample app](https://github.com/slack-samples/deno-simple-survey/blob/main/functions/save_response.ts):


    // Collect Google access token of the reactor
    const auth = await client.apps.auth.external.get({
    	external_token_id: inputs.reactor_access_token_id,
    	});

    	if (!auth.ok) {
    		return { error: `Failed to collect Google auth token: ${auth.error}` };
    	}
    // ...
