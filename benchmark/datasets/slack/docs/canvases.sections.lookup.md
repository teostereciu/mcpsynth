## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Auth token with which to authenticate the session

 _Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`canvas_id`** Required

Encoded ID of the canvas

 _Example:_`F1234ABCD`

**`criteria`** Required

Filtering criteria

 _Example:_`{"section_types": ["any_header"], "contains_text": "CAN Report"}`

## Usage info​

This method is used to identify sections within a canvas.

Those identifiers may then be used to edit the section or apply edits relative to that section. Refer to the [`canvases.edit`](/reference/methods/canvases.edit) method for more details.

Different `criteria` may be used in combination to narrow down the targeted section. Sections may be identified by `section_type`, which can be any of the following:

  * `h1`
  * `h2`
  * `h3`
  * `any_header`


For instance, using `"section_types": ["h1"]` in the `criteria` argument will search for all `h1` headings. Alternatively, using `any_header` will return the section IDs of any type of heading in the canvas. This may make more sense when used in combination with text criteria.

Sections may also be identified by the text they contain by using the `contains_text` property. Referencing the example below, this set of criteria will return the section IDs of any heading that is a `h1` or `h2` style and contains the words "Grocery List".


    {
        "canvas_id": "F0166DCSTS7",
        "criteria": {
            "section_types": ["h1", "h2"],
            "contains_text": "Grocery List"
        }
    }


Keep in mind, other types of sections exist that are not currently able to be used as a type to filter on. You may discover these when using a query with no section type provided.
