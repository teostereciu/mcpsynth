## Usage info​

This special method is part of implementing [Sign in with Slack](/authentication/sign-in-with-slack/).

As part of [Sign in with Slack](/authentication/sign-in-with-slack/), this method allows your app to receive information about a user who signs into your service with their Slack profile.

A potential gotcha: while `redirect_uri` is optional, it is _required_ if your app passed it as a parameter to `/openid/connect/authorize` in the first step of the Sign in with Slack flow.

## Response​

####

Successful token request during the Sign in with Slack flow


    {
      "ok": true,
      "access_token": "xoxp-1234",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "id_token": "eyJhbGcMjY5OTA2MzcWNrLmNvbVwvdGVhbV9p..."
    }


The `id_token` in the response is a [standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenResponse) JSON Web Token (JWT). . When it's decoded, you'll see a payload like:


      "iss": "https://slack.com",

      "aud": "25259531569.11152291",

`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `auth_time`, `nonce`, and `at_hash` are each defined by the [OpenID standard](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenResponse), but here's an overview:

  * `iss` signifies the issuer of the token.
  * `sub` signifies the subject of the token.
  * `aud` signifies the intended audience of the token, the client ID of the OpenID Relying Party.
  * `exp` signifies the expiration time of the request, meaning that it shouldn't be trusted if it's not received by the expiration time.
  * `iat` signifies the time when the token was issued.
  * `auth_time` signifies the time when the end-user authenticated.
  * `nonce` is a state variable that you pass to the `/openid/connect/authorize` endpoint at the beginning of Sign in with Slack, and that Slack then returns to you at the end of the flow here. Verify that it matches the `nonce` you passed to `/authorize`.
