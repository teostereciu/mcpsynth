**`name`**`string`Required

Name of the public or private channel to create

 _Example:_`mychannel`

## Usage info​

Create a public or private channel using this [Conversations API](/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api) method.

Use [`conversations.open`](/reference/methods/conversations.open) to initiate or resume a direct message or multi-person direct message.

The `team_id` is only relevant when using an org-level token. This field will be ignored if the API call is sent using a workspace-level token.

## Naming​

Channel names may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and must be 80 characters or less. When calling this method, we recommend storing both the channel's `id` and `name` value that returned in the response.

Channel names are always validated by this method.
