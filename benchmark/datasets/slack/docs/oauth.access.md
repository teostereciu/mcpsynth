`application/json`

**Rate Limits**[Tier 4: 100+ per minute](/apis/web-api/rate-limits)

## Arguments​

### Optional arguments

**`client_id`**`string`Optional

Issued when you created your application. If possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request and instead supply the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme.

_Example:_`2141029472.691202649728`

**`client_secret`**`string`Optional

Issued when you created your application. If possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request and instead supply the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme.

_Example:_`e1b9e11dfcd19c1982d5de12921e17e8c`

**`code`**`string`Optional

The `code` param returned via the OAuth callback.

_Example:_`4724469134.4644010092847.232b4e6d82c333b475fc30f5f5a341d294feb1a94392c2fd791f7ab7731a443d1a`

**`redirect_uri`**`string`Optional

This must match the originally submitted URI (if one was sent).

_Example:_`http://example.com`

**`single_channel`**`boolean`Optional

Request the user to add your app only to a single channel. Only valid with a [legacy workspace app](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2021-03-workspace-apps-to-retire-in-august-2021).

_Default:_`false`

 _Example:_`true`

## Usage info​

This is a legacy method only used by classic apps.

Use [oauth.v2.access](/reference/methods/oauth.v2.access) for [granular permissions Slack apps](/app-management/quickstart-app-settings)

This method allows you to exchange a temporary OAuth `code` for an API access token.

This is the third step of the [OAuth authentication flow](/authentication).

We strongly recommend supplying the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, as discussed [in RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).

If at all possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request.

**Keep your tokens secure**. Do not share tokens with users or anyone else.

When used with a legacy workspace app, this method's response differs significantly.

A potential gotcha: while `redirect_uri` is optional, it is _required_ if your app passed it as a parameter to `oauth/authorization` in the first step of the OAuth flow.

## Response​

####

Successful user token negotiation for a single scope


    {
      "access_token": "xoxp-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXX",
      "scope": "groups:write",
      "team_name": "Wyld Stallyns LLC",
      "team_id": "TXXXXXXXXX",
      "enterprise_id": null
    }

Success example when asking for multiple scopes, a bot user token, and an incoming webhook


    {
      "access_token": "xoxp-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXX",
      "scope": "incoming-webhook,commands,bot",
      "team_name": "Team Installing Your Hook",

Success example using a workspace app produces a very different kind of response

Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "invalid_client_id"
    }


The response schema for this step of OAuth differs depending on [the scopes](/reference/scopes) requested and the type of application used. When asking for the `bot` scope, you'll receive the token separately from the user token.

`enterprise_id` will be populated if the installing team is part of an enterprise. Otherwise, it will be `null`.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
