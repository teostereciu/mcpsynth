## Arguments​

### Optional arguments

**`client_id`**`string`Optional

Issued when you created your application. If possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request and instead supply the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme.

_Example:_`2141029472.691202649728`

**`client_secret`**`string`Optional

Issued when you created your application. If possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request and instead supply the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme.

_Example:_`e1b9e11dfcd19c1982d5de12921e17e8c`

**`code`**`string`Optional

The `code` param returned via the OAuth callback.

_Example:_`4724469134.4644010092847.232b4e6d82c333b475fc30f5f5a341d294feb1a94392c2fd791f7ab7731a443d1a`

**`code_verifier`**`string`Optional

The code_verifier param used to generate the code_challenge originally. Used for PKCE.

_Example:_`secret12345`

**`redirect_uri`**`string`Optional

This must match the originally submitted URI (if one was sent).

_Example:_`http://example.com`

**`grant_type`**`string`Optional

The `grant_type` param as described in the OAuth spec.

_Example:_`authorization_code`

**`refresh_token`**`string`Optional

The `refresh_token` param as described in the OAuth spec.

_Example:_`xoxe-1-abcdefg`

## Usage info​

Keep your tokens secure.

Do not share tokens with users or anyone else.

This is a step in the [V2 OAuth authentication flow](/authentication/installing-with-oauth). Check out our [guide to new Slack apps](/app-management/quickstart-app-settings) for more information.

If at all possible, avoid sending `client_id` and `client_secret` as parameters in your request. We strongly recommend supplying the Client ID and Client Secret using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, as discussed [in RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).

A potential gotcha: while `redirect_uri` is optional, it is _required_ if your app passed it as a parameter to `oauth/authorization` in the first step of the OAuth flow.

Look for the `is_enterprise_install` boolean if your app is an [org-ready app](/enterprise/organization-ready-apps) and you need to determine whether it has been installed on an entire organization or a single workspace.

If you're developing a [GovSlack](/govslack) app for use by public sector customers, make your API calls to the `slack-gov.com` domain instead of the `slack.com` domain.

### Rate limits​

The rate limit for this method is 600 per minute.

### Refresh tokens​

When you use `grant_type=refresh_token` and pass your `refresh_token` as an argument, this method _refreshes_ an access token, whether bot or user. Read our [guide to token rotation](/authentication/using-token-rotation) for more information.
