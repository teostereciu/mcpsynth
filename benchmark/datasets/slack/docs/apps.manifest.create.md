### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

An [app configuration access token](/authentication/tokens#config).

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`manifest`**`string`Required

A JSON app manifest encoded as a string. This manifest **must** use a valid [app manifest schema - read our guide to creating one](/app-manifests/configuring-apps-with-app-manifests#fields).

## Usage info​

### Using manifests​

This method accepts an app manifest as an argument. Read our [guide to app manifests](/app-manifests/configuring-apps-with-app-manifests) to learn how create or reuse them.

If you receive an `invalid_manifest` response when trying to use any App Manifest API, it indicates that the manifest you supplied didn't match the [correct schema](/reference/app-manifest#fields).

To better locate the problem with your manifest, the `invalid_manifest` error should be accompanied by an `errors` array:



    {
    	"ok": false,
    	"error": "invalid_manifest",
    	"errors": [
    		{
    			"message": "Event Subscription requires either Request URL or Socket Mode Enabled",
    			"pointer": "/settings/event_subscriptions"
    		},
    		{
    			"message": "Interactivity requires a Request URL",
    			"pointer": "/settings/interactivity"
    		},
    		{
    			"message": "Interactivity requires Socket Mode enabled",
    			"pointer": "/settings/interactivity"
    		}
    	]
    }



Each of the items in this array contain a `message` which describes the problem, and a `pointer` which indicates the problem's location within your supplied manifest. Use these two pieces of info to correct your manifest and try again.
