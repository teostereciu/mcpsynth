## Usage info​

_Interactive component_ \- see our [guide to enabling interactivity](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction).

The select menu also includes type-ahead functionality, where a user can type a part or all of an option string to filter the list.

There are different types of select menu elements that depend on different data sources for their lists of options:

  * Select menu of static options
  * Select menu of external data source
  * Select menu of users
  * Select menu of conversations
  * Select menu of public channels

## Select menu of static options​

This is the most basic form of select menu, with a static list of options passed in when defining the element.

### Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `static_select`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action triggered when a menu option is selected. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Optional| `options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object). Maximum number of options is 100. If `option_groups` is specified, this field should not be.| Required| `option_groups`| Object[]| An array of [option group objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-group-object). Maximum number of option groups is 100. If `options` is specified, this field should not be.| Optional| `initial_option`| Object| A single option that exactly matches one of the options within `options` or `option_groups`. This option will be selected when the menu initially loads.| Optional| `confirm`| Object| A [confirm object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears after a menu item is selected.| Optional| `focus_on_load`| Boolean| Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](/reference/views). Only one element can be set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.| Optional| `placeholder`| Object| A [`plain_text`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object) only text object that defines the placeholder text shown on the menu. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 150 characters.| Optional
---|---|---|---

### Example​

The select menu element must be used inside of the [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a static select menu.

## Select menu of external data source​

This select menu will load its options from an external data source, allowing for a dynamic list of options.

### Setup​

If you don't have [Socket Mode](/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode) enabled, you'll need to configure your app to use this menu type:

  1. Go to your [app's settings page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Interactivity & Shortcuts** from the sidebar.
  2. Add a URL to the **Options Load URL** under Select Menus.
  3. Save changes.


Each time a select menu of this type is opened or the user starts typing in the typeahead field, we'll send a request to your specified URL. Your app should return an HTTP 200 OK response, along with an `application/json` post body with an object containing either:

  * an [`options`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object) array
  * an [`option_groups`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-group-object) array


The `options` array can have a maximum number of 100 options.

The `option_groups` array can have a maximum number of 100 option groups, with each option group allowing up to 100 options.

Here's an example response:


    {
      "options": [
        {
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
          },
          "value": "value-0"
        },
        {
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
          },
          "value": "value-1"
        },
        {
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
          },
          "value": "value-2"
        }
      ]
    }
