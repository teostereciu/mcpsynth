## Usage info​

Stars can still be removed via `stars.remove` but they can no longer be viewed or interacted with by end-users.

We recommend retiring any app functionality that relies on `stars` APIs.

End-users can use the [new Later view](https://slack.com/help/articles/13453851074067-Save-it-for-Later), but Later APIs are not currently available.

See [this changelog](/changelog/2023-07-its-later-already-for-stars-and-reminders) for more information.

This method removes a star from an item (message, file, file comment, channel, private group, or DM) on behalf of the authenticated user. One of `file`, `file_comment`, `channel`, or the combination of `channel` and `timestamp` must be specified.
