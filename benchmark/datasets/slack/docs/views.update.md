## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`view`** Required

A [view object](/reference/views). This must be a JSON-encoded string.

### Optional arguments

**`view_id`**`string`Optional

A unique identifier of the view to be updated. Either `view_id` or `external_id` is required.

_Example:_`VMM512F2U`

**`external_id`**`string`Optional

A unique identifier of the view set by the developer. Must be unique for all views on a team. Max length of 255 characters. Either `view_id` or `external_id` is required.

_Example:_`bmarley_view2`

**`hash`**`string`Optional

A string that represents view state to protect against possible race conditions.

_Example:_`156772938.1827394`

## Usage info​

Update a view by passing a new view definition object along with the `view_id` returned in [`views.open`](/reference/methods/views.open) or the `external_id`. See the [modals](/surfaces/modals#updating_apis) documentation to learn more about updating views and avoiding race conditions with the `hash` argument.

Preserving `input` entry

Data entered or selected in `input` blocks can be preserved while updating views. The new `view` object that you use with `views.update` should contain the same input blocks and elements with identical `block_id` and `action_id` values.
