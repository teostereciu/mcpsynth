[`chat:write`](/reference/scopes/chat.write)

User token:

[`chat:write`](/reference/scopes/chat.write)

`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

`application/json`

**Rate Limits**[Tier 3: 50+ per minute](/apis/web-api/rate-limits)

## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`channel`**`string`Required

Channel containing the message to be updated. For direct messages, ensure that this value is a DM ID (starts with `D`) instead of a User ID (starts with either `U` or `W`).

**`ts`**`string`Required

Timestamp of the message to be updated.

_Example:_`"1405894322.002768"`

### Optional arguments

**`as_user`** Optional

Pass true to update the message as the authed user. Bot users in this context are considered authed users.

_Example:_`true`

**`attachments`** Optional

A JSON-based array of structured attachments, presented as a URL-encoded string.

_Example:_`[{"pretext": "pre-hello", "text": "text-world"}]`

**`unfurled_attachments`** Optional

A JSON-based array of structured attachments, presented as a URL-encoded string.

_Example:_`[{"pretext": "pre-hello", "text": "text-world"}]`

**`blocks`** Optional

A JSON-based array of structured blocks, presented as a URL-encoded string.

_Example:_`[{"type": "section", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Hello world"}}]`

**`markdown_text`**`string`Optional

Accepts message text formatted in markdown. This argument should not be used in conjunction with `blocks` or `text`. Limit this field to 12,000 characters.

_Example:_`**This is bold text**`

 **`metadata`** Optional

JSON object with event_type and event_payload fields, presented as a URL-encoded string. If you don't include this field, the message's previous `metadata` will be retained. To remove previous `metadata`, include an empty object for this field. Metadata you post to Slack is accessible to any app or user who is a member of that workspace.

_Example:_`{"event_type": "task_created", "event_payload": { "id": "11223", "title": "Redesign Homepage"}}`

**`link_names`** Optional

Find and link channel names and usernames. Defaults to `none`. If you do not specify a value for this field, the original value set for the message will be overwritten with the default, `none`.

_Example:_`true`

**`parse`** Optional

Change how messages are treated. Defaults to `client`, unlike `chat.postMessage`. Accepts either `none` or `full`. If you do not specify a value for this field, the original value set for the message will be overwritten with the default, `client`.

_Example:_`none`

**`text`** Optional

How this field works and whether it is required depends on other fields you use in your API call. See below for more detail.

_Example:_`Hello world`

**`reply_broadcast`**`boolean`Optional

Broadcast an existing thread reply to make it visible to everyone in the channel or conversation.

_Default:_`false`

 _Example:_`true`

**`file_ids`**`array`Optional

Array of new file ids that will be sent with this message.

_Example:_`F013GKY52QK,F013GL22D0T or ["F013GKY52QK","F013GL22D0T"]`

## Usage info​

This method updates a message in a channel. Though related to [`chat.postMessage`](/reference/methods/chat.postMessage), some parameters of `chat.update` are handled differently.

Ephemeral messages created by [`chat.postEphemeral`](/reference/methods/chat.postEphemeral) or otherwise cannot be updated with this method.

New Slack apps may use this method with the [`chat:write`](/reference/scopes/chat.write) scope and either a bot or user token.

To define your message, refer to our [formatting spec](/messaging/formatting-message-text) and our guide to [composing messages](/messaging).

### `text`, `blocks` or `attachments`​

This method will behave differently depending on whether `blocks` or `text` is supplied. Slack will always try to render the message using `blocks`, and use `text` only for notifications. If you don't include `blocks`, the message's previous `blocks` will only be retained if the `text` argument is not provided. If the `text` argument is provided and `blocks` are not provided, the `blocks` will be removed, and the provided `text` will be used for message rendering. To remove previous `blocks`, include an empty array for the `blocks` field. If `blocks` are used and a message is being updated, the `edited` flag will not be displayed on the message (the flag will be displayed on the message if using `text`).

Similarly, the `attachments` field is required when not presenting `text`. If you don't include `attachments`, the message's previous `attachments` will be retained. To remove previous `attachments`, include an empty array for this field.

## Valid message types​

Only messages posted by the authenticated user are able to be updated using this method. This includes regular chat messages, as well as messages containing the `me_message` subtype. Bot users may also update the messages they post.

Attempting to update other message types will return a `cant_update_message` error.

To use `chat.update` with a bot users token, you'll need to _think of your bot user as a user_ , and pass `as_user` set to `true` while editing a message created by that same bot user.

## Response​

####

Typical success response


    {
      "ok": true,
      "channel": "C123ABC456",
      "ts": "1401383885.000061",
      "text": "Updated text you carefully authored",
      "message": {
        "text": "Updated text you carefully authored",
        "user": "U34567890"
      }
    }


####

Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "cant_update_message"
    }


The response includes the `text`, `channel` and `timestamp` properties of the updated message so clients can keep their local copies of the message in sync.

### Updating interactive messages​

If you're posting an [interactive message](/messaging/creating-interactive-messages), you may use `chat.update` to continue updating ongoing state changes around a message. Provide the `ts` field the message you're updating and follow the bot user instructions above to update message text, and remove or add blocks.
