## Usage info​

Deprecated

[Learn more about this method's deprecation.](/changelog/2021-10-rtm-start-to-stop)

This method began a Real Time Messaging API session and reserved your application a specific URL with which to connect via websocket.

It's user-centric and team-centric: your app connects _as_ a specific user or bot user on a specific team. Many apps will find the [Events API](/apis/events-api/)'s subscription model more scalable when working against multiple teams.

Please proactively [`rtm.connect`](/reference/methods/rtm.connect) instead. Existing apps still using `rtm.start` after September 27, 2022 now get the response from that method instead.

Consult the [RTM API documentation](/legacy/legacy-rtm-api) for full details on using the RTM API.

[New Slack apps](/quickstart) may not use any Real Time Messaging API method.

For most applications [Socket Mode](/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode) is a better way to communicate with Slack, anyway.
