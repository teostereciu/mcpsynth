Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

**`invite_id`** Required

ID of the requested shared channel invite to approve.

### Optional arguments

**`is_external_limited`**`boolean`Optional

Optional boolean on whether the invited team will have post-only permissions in the channel. Will override the value on the requested invite.

**`channel_id`**`string`Optional

Optional channel_id to which external user will be invited to. Will override the value on the requested invite.

**`message`**`object`Optional

Object describing the text to send along with the invite. If this object is specified, both `text` and `is_override` are required properties. If `is_override` is set to `true`, `text` will override the original invitation message. Otherwise, `text` will be appended to the original invitation message. The total length of the message cannot exceed 560 characters. If `is_override` is set to `false`, the length of `text` and the user specified message on the invite request in total must be less than 560 characters.

_Example:_`{"text": "hello", "is_override": true}`

## Usage info​

This [Slack Connect API](/apis/slack-connect/using-slack-connect-api-methods) method approves a requested [Slack Connect invitation](/apis/slack-connect/). As a result, an email invitation will be sent to an external user. An external user may be added directly to the channel if the external workspace is already connected to the channel. If the channel to be joined is not already a Slack Connect channel, it _becomes_ a Slack Connect channel when this method is used.

### Prerequisites​

  * You must have administrator access to a workspace that is part of an [Enterprise plan](https://app.slack.com/plans/T01G0063H29).
  * You must have the following settings configured within your Admin Dashboard under **Slack Connect Settings** : a) Toggle on the **Apply automation rules before channel invitations are sent** preference. b) Under **Channels** , toggle on either the **Sending Invitations with Permission to Post Only** or the **Sending Invitations with permission to post, invite and more** preference.


For more details, refer to [governing Slack Connect invites](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/tutorials/governing-slack-connect-invites).

### Using the `channel_id` argument​

The `channel_id` argument allows the approver to override the channel from which Slack Connect invitations will be sent. The channel must be visible to the user who requested the invitation.

### Using the `is_external_limited` argument​

The `is_external_limited` argument allows the approver to override the value on the requested invitation. The user requesting the invitation must have permission to send Slack Connect invitations with the specified value.
