## Usage info​

Lists are only available to Slack workspaces on a paid plan.

This method allow you to update a List name, description, and TODO mode. TODO mode is used by clients to hide task tracking fields when `todo_mode` is set false, or to unhide or create task tracking fields when `todo_mode` is set true.

Task tracking fields are as follows:

  * Completed: a boolean column (column type `todo_completed`) for tracking when an item is completed or not.
  * Assignee: a people column (column type `todo_assignee`) for storing who the assignee is for a given List item.
  * Due date: a date column (column type `todo_due_date`) for storing when the List item is due.
