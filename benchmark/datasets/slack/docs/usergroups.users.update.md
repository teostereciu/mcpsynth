Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`usergroup`**`string`Required

The encoded ID of the user group to update.

_Example:_`S0604QSJC`

### Optional arguments

**`include_count`**`boolean`Optional

Include the number of users in the user group.

_Example:_`true`

**`team_id`**`string`Optional

encoded team id where the user group exists, required if org token is used

**`additional_channels`**`array`Optional

**`is_shared`**`boolean`Optional

Boolean to identify if the API is getting called when a shared section is getting shared

## Usage info​

This method updates the list of users that belong to a user group. It replaces all users in a user group with the list of users provided in the `users` parameter.

In order to call this method successfully, you'll need to ensure that your workspace settings allow you to manage user groups; otherwise you will receive a `permission_denied` error.

To update this setting, navigate to **Tools & settings > Workspace settings > Permissions > User Groups** within your workspace and update who can create, disable, or modify user groups from the drop-down menus.

If user group permissions cannot be changed and are restricted to admins only, use the user token from a user with the correct permissions. A bot token can be used only if permissions are set to `everyone`.

You cannot use this method to remove all members from a user group. Instead, use the [`usergroups.disable`](/reference/methods/usergroups.disable) method. If you need to reactivate the user group later, use the [`usergroups.enable`](/reference/methods/usergroups.enable) method.

Guests or bot users cannot be added to user groups; attempting to do so will result in an `invalid_user` error (or in the case of single channel guests, a `single_channel_guests_cannot_be_added` error).

The `team_id` is only relevant when using an org-level token. This field will be ignored if the API call is sent using a workspace-level token.

### POST Bodies​

As outlined in [Using the Slack Web API](/apis/web-api/#slack-web-api__basics__post-bodies), you may present your arguments as either standard POST parameters, or you may use JSON. This can be confusing in terms of the array argument type (`users`), so let's clarify: to call the method with a URL-encoded string, it may look something like this:


    users=U0130R122E8%2C%20U0133AHT0M8


while calling it with a JSON body should be formatted as follows:


    "users": [
    		"U0130R122E8",
            "U0133AHT0M8"
    		]


Both will yield the same result, so it's potato, po-tah-to as far as we're concerned.
