This [app event](/apis/events-api/#app_events) notifies your app when a user has entered the [App Home](/surfaces/app-home).

Your Slack app must have a bot user configured and installed to use this event.

If the user opens a tab within the App Home, the event payload for this event will reference that in the `tab` field. If they opened a [Home tab](/surfaces/app-home) and that tab has had a `view` published at least once before, a `view` field will also be included. That `view` field will contain the current state of the Home tab, including the list of `blocks`, and various pieces of metadata.

Use the `app_home_opened` event to begin a friendly onboarding flow from your app, a whimsical welcome message, or a deep-dive into a detailed dialog. Since the `app_home_opened` event is only sent to your app when a user has already clicked on your app, you can be sure that your attentions are welcome.

`app_home_opened` events are sent _each time_ a user enters into the App Home space.

Verify that this is the first interaction between a user and your app before triggering your onboarding flow.

`app_home_opened` events are just like other `message` events sent over the Events API, but their `type` indicates `app_home_opened`.
