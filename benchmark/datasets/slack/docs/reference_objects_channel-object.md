# Channel

*Source: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/objects/channel-object*

---

A channel object is a legacy object that contains information about a workspace channel. These channel objects are not the same object type as private channels, which are considered [group objects](/reference/objects/group-object). Channels and groups are now considered a type of [conversation](/reference/objects/conversation-object).

## Channel object fields​

Field| Type| Description| `id`| string| The channel ID.| `name`| string| Indicates the name of the channel-like thing, without a leading hash sign. Don't get too attached to that name. It might change. Don't even bother storing it. When thinking about channel-like things, think about their IDs, their type, and the team/workspace they belong to.| `is_channel`| boolean| Indicates if it is a channel.| `created`| Unix timestamp| Timestamp of when the channel was created.| `creator`| string| The user ID of the member that created the channel.| `is_archived`| boolean| `true` if the channel is archived.| `is_general`| boolean| `true` if this channel is the "general" channel that includes all regular members. In most workspaces this is called `#general`, but some workspaces have renamed it.| `name_normalized`| string| A normalized string of the name.| `is_shared`| boolean| `true` if the channel is shared.| `is_org_shared`| boolean| Indicates if the organization which the channel belongs to is shared.| `is_member`| boolean| `true` if the calling member is part of the channel.| `is_private`| boolean| Indicates if the channel is private.| `is_mpim`| boolean| Indicates if the channel is a multi-party instant message.| `last_read`| Unix timestamp| The timestamp for the last message the calling user has read in this channel.| `latest`| object| The latest message in the channel.| `unread_count`| integer| A full count of visible messages that the calling user has yet to read.| `unread_count_display`| integer| A count of messages that the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (this means it excludes things like join/leave messages).| `members`| array| A list of user IDs for all users in this channel. This includes any disabled accounts that were in this channel when they were disabled.| `topic`| object| The topic of the channel.| `purpose`| object| The purpose of the channel.| `previous_names`| array| A list of prior names the channel has used.
