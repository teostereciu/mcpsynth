## Usage info​

This endpoint converts a team in a shared channel from an external limited channel to a fully shared [Slack Connect](/apis/slack-connect/using-slack-connect-api-methods) channel or vice versa. An external limited channel gives external channel members permission only to post, while a fully shared Slack Connect channel gives external members permission to post, invite, and more. Refer to Slack Connect [permissions](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012572621-Slack-Connect--Manage-channel-invitation-settings-and-permissions-) for full breakdown.
