In this case `type` is always `file_input`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the input value when the parent modal is submitted.

## Usage info​

In order to use the `file_input` element within your app, your app must have the [`files:read`](/reference/scopes/files.read) scope. There is a 10MB file size limit.

## Example​

The file input element must be used inside the [input block](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block, like this:


    {
        "title": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "My App",
            "emoji": true
        },
        "submit": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Submit",
            "emoji": true
        },
        "type": "modal",
        "close": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Cancel",
            "emoji": true
        },
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "input",
                "block_id": "input_block_id",
                "label": {
                    "type": "plain_text",
                    "text": "Upload Files"
                },
                "element": {
                    "type": "file_input",
                    "action_id": "file_input_action_id_1",

                        "jpg",
                        "png"
                    ],
                    "max_files": 5
                }
