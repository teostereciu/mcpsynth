The `files.upload` API method has been deprecated. It will stop functioning and be officially sunset on November 12, 2025.

Existing apps and integrations should migrate away from `files.upload` and instead leverage a combination of two API methods: [`files.getUploadURLExternal`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/files.getUploadURLExternal/) and [`files.completeUploadExternal`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/methods/files.completeUploadExternal/). See [Uploading files](/messaging/working-with-files#uploading_files) for more details on the process, and read more about the change in this [changelog article](https://docs.slack.dev/changelog/2024-04-a-better-way-to-upload-files-is-here-to-stay/).

**Rate Limits**[Tier 2: 20+ per minute](/apis/web-api/rate-limits)

## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

### Optional arguments

**`channels`**`string`Optional

Comma-separated list of channel names or IDs where the file will be shared.

**`content`**`string`Optional

File contents via a POST variable. If omitting this parameter, you must provide a `file`.

_Example:_`...`

**`file`** Optional

File contents via `multipart/form-data`. If omitting this parameter, you must submit `content`.

_Example:_`...`

**`filename`**`string`Optional

Filename of file.

_Example:_`foo.txt`

**`filetype`**`string`Optional

A [file type](/reference/objects/file-object#file_types) identifier.

_Example:_`php`

**`initial_comment`**`string`Optional

The message text introducing the file in specified `channels`.

_Example:_`Best!`

**`thread_ts`**`string`Optional

Provide another message's `ts` value to upload this file as a reply. Never use a reply's `ts` value; use its parent instead.

**`title`**`string`Optional

Title of file.

_Example:_`My File`

## Usage info​

This method allows you to create or upload an existing file.

**You must provide either a`file` or `content` parameter.**

The content of the file can either be posted using an `enctype` of `multipart/form-data` (with the file parameter named `file`), in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser, or the content of the file can be sent as a POST var called `content`. The latter should be used for creating a "file" from a long message/paste and forces "editable" mode.

In both cases, the type of data in the file will be intuited from the filename and the magic bytes in the file, for supported formats.

Sending a valid `filetype` parameter will override this behavior. Possible `filetype` values can be found in the [`file` object definition](/reference/objects/file-object#file_types).

Files uploaded via `multipart/form-data` will be stored either in hosted or editable mode, based on certain heuristics (determined type, file size).

The file can also be shared directly into channels on upload, by specifying an optional argument `channels`. If there's more than one channel name or ID in the `channels` string, they should be comma-separated. The owner of the token used to upload the file must also be a member of any channel you wish to post to this way.

There is a 1 megabyte file size limit for files uploaded as snippets.

Upload files and images into [message threads](/messaging#threading) by providing the thread parent's `ts` value with the `thread_ts` parameter.

The `initial_comment` field is used in messages to introduce the file in conversation.

If you only specify a `filename`, we remove the file extension and populate the file's `title` with the remaining value. So, if you want the file's extension to be shown in Slack, you must include it in the `title` argument when uploading it.

Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "invalid_auth"
    }


By default all newly-uploaded files are private and only visible to the owner. They become public once they are shared into a public channel (which can happen at upload time via the `channels` argument).

If successful, the response will include a [file object](/reference/objects/file-object).

## Examples​

Upload "dramacat.gif" from the current directory and share it in two channels, using `multipart/form-data`:


    curl -F file=@dramacat.gif -F "initial_comment=Shakes the cat" -F channels=C024BE91L,D032AC32T -H "Authorization: Bearer xoxb-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx" https://slack.com/api/files.upload


Create an editable text file containing the text "launch plan":


    curl -F "content=launch plan" -H "Authorization: Bearer xoxb-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx" https://slack.com/api/files.upload


Upload another image to an existing message thread:


    curl -F file=@drworm.gif -F "initial_comment=I play the drums." -F channels=C024BE91L -F thread_ts=1532293503.000001 -H "Authorization: Bearer xoxp-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx" https://slack.com/api/files.upload
