## Usage info​

This method begins a Real Time Messaging API session and reserves your application a specific URL with which to connect via websocket.

Unlike [`rtm.start`](/reference/methods/rtm.start), this method is focused only on connecting to the RTM API.

Use this method in conjunction with other Web API methods like [`conversations.list`](/reference/methods/conversations.list), [`users.list`](/reference/methods/users.list), and [`team.info`](/reference/methods/team.info) to build a full picture of the team or workspace you're connecting on behalf of.

Please consult the [RTM API documentation](/legacy/legacy-rtm-api) for full details on using the RTM API.

[New Slack apps](/quickstart) may not use any Real Time Messaging API method.

For most applications, [Socket Mode](/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode) is a better way to communicate with Slack anyway.

## Response​

####

Typical success response


    {
      "ok": true,
      "self": {
        "id": "U4X318ZMZ",
        "name": "robotoverlord"
      },
      "team": {
        "domain": "slackdemo",
        "id": "T2U81E2FP",
        "name": "SlackDemo"
      },
      "url": "wss://..."
    }


####

Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "invalid_auth"
    }


This method returns a WebSocket Message Server URL and limited information about the team: The `url` property contains a WebSocket Message Server URL. Connecting to this URL will initiate a Real Time Messaging session. These URLs are only valid for 30 seconds, so connect quickly!

The `self` property contains a small amount of information concerning the connecting user — an `id` and their `name`.

The `team` attribute also houses brief information about the team, including its `id`, `name`, `domain`, and if it's part of an [Enterprise organization](/enterprise), the corresponding `enterprise_id`.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
