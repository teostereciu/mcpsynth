## Example​

The feedback buttons element must be used inside the [context actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/context-actions-block) block, like this:


    {
      "blocks": [
        {
          "type": "context_actions",
          "elements": [
            {
              "type": "feedback_buttons",
              "action_id": "feedback_buttons_1",
              "positive_button": {
                "text": {
                  "type": "plain_text",
                  "text": "Good"
                },
                "value": "positive_feedback",
                "accessibility_label": "Mark this response as good"
              },
              "negative_button": {
                "text": {
                  "type": "plain_text",
                  "text": "Bad"
                },
                "value": "negative_feedback",
                "accessibility_label": "Mark this response as bad"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
