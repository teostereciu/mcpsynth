This [Slack Connect API](/apis/slack-connect/using-slack-connect-api-methods) method denies a requested [Slack Connect invitation](/apis/slack-connect/).

## Prerequisites​

  * You must have administrator access to a workspace that is part of an [Enterprise plan](https://app.slack.com/plans/T01G0063H29).
  * You must have the following settings configured within your Admin Dashboard under **Slack Connect Settings** : a) Toggle on the **Apply automation rules before channel invitations are sent** preference. b) Under **Channels** , toggle on either the **Sending Invitations with Permission to Post Only** or the **Sending Invitations with permission to post, invite and more** preference.


For more details, refer to [governing Slack Connect invites](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/tutorials/governing-slack-connect-invites).

### Using the `message` argument​

The `message` argument allows the actor to specify the deny message, which will be sent to the invite requestor.
