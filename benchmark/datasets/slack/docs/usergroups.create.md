## Usage info​

This method is used to create a User Group.

In order to call this method successfully, you'll need to ensure that your workspace settings allow you to manage user groups; otherwise you will receive a `permission_denied` error.

To update this setting, navigate to **Tools & settings > Workspace settings > Permissions > User Groups** within your workspace and update who can create, disable, or modify user groups from the drop-down menus.

The `team_id` is only relevant when using an org-level token. This field will be ignored if the API call is sent using a workspace-level token.
