## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

### Optional arguments

**`channel`** Optional

Resume a conversation by supplying an `im` or `mpim`'s ID. Or provide the `users` field instead.

**`return_im`**`boolean`Optional

Boolean, indicates you want the full IM channel definition in the response.

**`users`**`string`Optional

Comma separated lists of users. If only one user is included, this creates a 1:1 DM. The ordering of the users is preserved whenever a multi-person direct message is returned. Supply a `channel` when not supplying `users`.

**`prevent_creation`**`boolean`Optional

Do not create a direct message or multi-person direct message. This is used to see if there is an existing dm or mpdm.

## Usage info​

The [Conversations API](/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api) method opens a direct message (DM) or a multi-person direct message (MPIM).

You can then send a message to the conversation using the [`chat.postMessage`](/reference/methods/chat.postMessage) method.

Creating channels

Use the [`conversations.create](/reference/methods/conversations.create) method instead for public or private channels.

##### Using the `users` parameter​

Provide 1 to 8 user IDs in the `users` parameter to open or resume a conversation. Providing only 1 ID will create a direct message. Providing more than 1 will create a multi-person direct message (`mpim`).

Don’t include the ID of the user you’re calling `conversations.open` on behalf of – we do that for you.

If there are no conversations already in progress including that exact set of members, a new multi-person direct message conversation begins.

Subsequent calls to `conversations.open` with the same set of users will return the already existing conversation.

## Response​

####

Typical success response


    {
      "ok": true,
      "channel": {
        "id": "D069C7QFK"
      }
    }


####

Passing `return_im` will expand the response to include more info about a conversation


    {
      "ok": true,
      "no_op": true,
      "already_open": true,
      "channel": {
        "id": "D069C7QFK",
        "created": 1460147748,
        "is_im": true,
        "is_org_shared": false,
        "user": "U069C7QF3",
        "last_read": "0000000000.000000",
        "latest": null,
        "unread_count": 0,
        "unread_count_display": 0,
        "is_open": true,
        "priority": 0
      }
    }


####

Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "channel_not_found"
    }


The response structure is altered by providing `return_im` parameter. When set to `false`, the default, just a conversation's ID is returned. When set to `true`, the entire conversation object is returned.
