Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "invalid_cursor"
    }


Returns a list of [paginated](/apis/web-api/pagination) requested invitations objects ordered by IDs in ascending order.

### Pagination​

This method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.

Responses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.

See [pagination](/apis/web-api/pagination) for more information.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
