## Usage info​

This method is used to create a new channel canvas for the channel. Channel canvases can act as a resource hub, providing users with information highlights and channel-specific details. Once a channel canvas has been created with `document_content`, you will see the canvas icon in the upper right of the channel switch to indicate that a channel canvas now exists. This method returns an `ok: true` response with the canvas ID.

A canvas will be created empty if no content is provided, but will not result in an icon change.

The following formatting elements are supported in the `document_content` object:

  * bold
  * bulleted lists
  * checklist
  * canvas unfurl
  * code block
  * code span
  * divider (horizontal rule)
  * emojis—standard and custom
  * file unfurls
  * hard line break
  * headings h1-h3
  * italic
  * link (in line)
  * link reference
  * markdown table
  * message unfurl
  * ordered lists
  * paragraph
  * profile unfurl
  * quote block
  * strikethrough
  * website unfurl
  * @ mentions for users and channels


Calling `conversations.canvases.create` when a channel canvas already exists will result in a `channel_canvas_already_exists` response. You can find the ID of the canvas in the `channel.properties.canvas` section in the response of a [`conversations.info`](/reference/methods/conversations.info) request.

In order for your app to create a channel canvas, it must have the proper permissions to do so. The channel must be public, or if it is private the app/user must be invited to the channel. Unlike the need to [share a standalone canvas](/reference/methods/canvases.create), there are no access implications nor is it necessary to share a channel canvas to grant access. Access is tied to channel access.

If you are looking to create a standalone canvas not associated with a particular channel, use the [`canvases.create`](/reference/methods/canvases.create) method instead.
