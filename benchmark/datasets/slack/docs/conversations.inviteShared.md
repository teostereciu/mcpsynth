Optional email to receive this invite. Either `emails` or `user_ids` must be provided. Only one email or one user ID may be invited at a time.

**`user_ids`**`array`Optional

Optional user_id to receive this invite. Either `emails` or `user_ids` must be provided. Only one email or one user ID may be invited at a time.

## Usage info​

This [Slack Connect API](/apis/slack-connect/using-slack-connect-api-methods) method creates an invitation to a [Slack Connect](/apis/slack-connect/) channel. The invitation can be sent to users or bots in another workspace either as a shareable URL or as an email invite.

The invited user must be known to your app (i.e., a channel is already shared between the organization your app is installed on and the organization of the user). If the channel to be joined is not already a Slack Connect channel, it _becomes_ a Connect channel when you use this method to invite users from another workspace.

## Response​

####

Typical success response


    {
      "ok": true,
      "invite_id": "I02UKAJ6RJA",
      "is_legacy_shared_channel": false
    }


####

Typical error response when no email address or user ID is provided


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "restricted_action"
    }


### With the `user_ids` argument​

If you supply a user's ID via the `user_ids` argument, we'll send a notification to the recipient's Slack client for them to accept.


    {
    	"ok": true,
    	"invite_id": "I02UKAJ6RJA",
    	"is_legacy_shared_channel": false
    }


### With the `emails` argument​

If you supply a user's email via the `emails` argument, we'll send a transactional email to the recipient containing a URL that triggers joining the Slack Connect channel. Some fields are omitted if `external_limited=true` (see below).


    {
    	"ok": true,
    	"invite_id": "I02UKAJ6RJA",
    	"is_legacy_shared_channel": false
    }


Please note that even though the `emails` and `user_ids` arguments accept arrays, only one email or one user ID may be invited at a time.

### With the `external_limited` argument​

Setting this argument to `true` will send an invitation limiting recipient's actions to only sending messages. They will not be able to invite other members (or bots) from their organization into the channel. They will also not be able to export the channel history, change its visibility, or change the channel topic or name. The channel will be set as private in the guest workspace.

Since this argument defaults to `true`, your app will need to explicitly set it to `false` if you would like the recipient to have more control over the channel in their workspace.

The ability to send either Slack Connect invitation type is controlled by the workspace setting [Manage permissions for inviting people to channels](https://slack.com/help/articles/360050528953). If an invite is sent of a type your app does not have permission to send, the `restricted_action` error is returned. For example, if the workspace is configured to disallow users from sending invitations with permission to post, invite, and more, setting `external_limited=false` will return an error.

When `external_limited=true`, the `conf_code` and `url` fields are not returned in the success response.

## Errors​

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
