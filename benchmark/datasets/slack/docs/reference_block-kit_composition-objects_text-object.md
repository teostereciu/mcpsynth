# Text

*Source: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object*

---

**Defines an object containing some text.**

Formatted either as `plain_text` or using [`mrkdwn`](/messaging/formatting-message-text), our proprietary contribution to the much beloved [Markdown standard](https://xkcd.com/927/).

#### Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The formatting to use for this text object. Can be one of `plain_text`or `mrkdwn`.| Required| `text`| String| The text for the block. This field accepts any of the standard [text formatting markup](/messaging/formatting-message-text) when `type` is `mrkdwn`. The minimum length is 1 and maximum length is 3000 characters.| Required| `emoji`| Boolean| Indicates whether emojis in a text field should be escaped into the colon emoji format. This field is only usable when `type` is `plain_text`.| Optional| `verbatim`| Boolean| When set to `false` (as is default) URLs will be auto-converted into links, conversation names will be link-ified, and certain mentions will be [automatically parsed](/messaging/formatting-message-text#automatic-parsing). When set to `true`, Slack will continue to process all markdown formatting and [manual parsing strings](/messaging/formatting-message-text#advanced), but it won’t modify any plain-text content. For example, channel names will not be hyperlinked. This field is only usable when `type` is `mrkdwn`.|

#### Example​

The text object must be used within another block or element, such as the [header](/reference/block-kit/blocks/header-block) block, [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [button](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/button-element) element, [icon](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/icon-button-element) button element, or [workflow button](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/workflow-button-element) element. This example shows a section block containing a text object.


    {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "section",
                "text": {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": "A message *with some bold text* and _some italicized text_."
                }
            }
        ]
    }
