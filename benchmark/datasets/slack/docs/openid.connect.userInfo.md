This method retrieves user info for a user who has previously authenticated to your service with [Sign in with Slack](/authentication/sign-in-with-slack/).

Some of the fields in the response to this method are preceded with `https://slack.com/`—these fields are Slack-specific, and they're from the perspective of Slack. For example, `https://slack.com/user_id` indicates the user's ID on Slack, not on your service.

`team_image_default` indicates whether the image is a default one (`true`), or someone uploaded their own (`false`).
