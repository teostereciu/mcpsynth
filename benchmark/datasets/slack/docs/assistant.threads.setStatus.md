## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`channel_id`**`string`Required

Channel ID containing the assistant thread.

**`thread_ts`**`string`Required

Message timestamp of the thread of where to set the status.

**`status`**`string`Required

Status of the specified bot user, e.g., 'is thinking...'. A two minute timeout applies, which will cause the status to be removed if no message has been sent.

### Optional arguments

**`loading_messages`**`array`Optional

The list of messages to rotate through as a loading indicator. Maximum of 10 messages.

## Usage info​

Scope update

The `assistant.threads.setStatus` API method accepts either the [`assistant:write`](/reference/scopes/assistant.write) or [`chat:write`](/reference/scopes/chat.write) scope for the time being. Soon, this method will only accept the [`chat:write`](/reference/scopes/chat.write) scope. Read all about the change in this [changelog article](/changelog/2026/03/05/set-status-scope-update).

Use this method to push status updates to users in apps using AI features.

This method helps apps set expectations for potentially slow responses; e.g. "app is thinking...". The status will be automatically cleared when the app sends a reply. Sending an empty string in the `status` field will also clear the status indicator. This can be handy if you want to clear the status indicator without sending a new message.

The status is displayed as `<App Name> <status>`, and Slack automatically inserts the `<App Name>`. So for the example below, if the app's name is `YourAssistantJeeves`, the status would render as `YourAssistantJeeves is working on your request...`.

You can also set a custom loading state via the `loading_messages` parameter. The `loading_messages` parameter is an array of strings that Slack will rotate through showing to serve as a loading indicator.

Consider the following

Localizing the status indicator and loading state messages for the end user is a great way to provide a smooth user experience for everyone.

Example request:


    {
       "status": "is working on your request...",
       "channel_id": "D324567865",
       "thread_ts": "1724264405.531769"
    }



### Rate limits​

Rate limiting conditions for this method include a default rate limit that is sufficient for most apps, with custom overrides determined on a per-team basis. The default limit is 600 requests per minute (per app per team).
