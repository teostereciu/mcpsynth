## Usage info​

This block can be used with [apps that use platform AI features](/ai/) when you expect a markdown response from an LLM that can get lost in translation rendering in Slack. Providing it in a markdown block leaves the translating to Slack to ensure your message appears as intended. Note that passing a single block may result in multiple blocks after translation.

## Examples​

  * JSON
  * Python SDK
  * Node SDK
  * Java SDK
