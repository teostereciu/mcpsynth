## Usage info​

Lists are only available to Slack workspaces on a paid plan.

This method is used to create a new item, also known as a record, in an existing List.

The item will be created with the field values specified in the `initial_fields` parameter. Each field corresponds to a column in the List and must reference a valid `column_id`.

The response includes the created item with all its field values, plus metadata:

  * `id`: The unique identifier for the created item.
  * `list_id`: The List the item belongs to.
  * `date_created`: Unix timestamp when the item was created.
  * `created_by`: User ID of the user who created the item.
  * `updated_by`: User ID of the user who last updated the item.
  * `updated_timestamp`: String timestamp of last update.
  * `parent_record_id`: Present if this is a subtask.
  * `fields`: Array of all field values with their formatted representations.


## Sample requests data​

### Minimal​


    {
      "token": "***",
      "list_id": "F1234ABCD"
    }


### With initial field values​

Provide field values using the `initial_fields` parameter:


    {
      "token": "***",
      "list_id": "F1234ABCD",
      "initial_fields": [
        {
          "column_id": "Col10000000",
          "rich_text": [
            {
              "type": "rich_text",
              "elements": [
                {
                  "type": "rich_text_section",
                  "elements": [
                    {
                      "type": "text",
                      "text": "List of favorite shows"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }


### Text column (plain text)​

While a bit counterintuitive, you must use `rich_text` blocks in a request that includes plain text. This is because List text fields are always rich text in order to create consistency across Slack's text editing experience. You may see the `text` property appear in a response as a fallback, but it is not accepted in the request payload. Instead, format your request using the Block Kit `rich_text` block as in the example below:


    {
      "token": "***",
      "list_id": "F1234ABCD",
      "initial_fields": [
        {
          "column_id": "Col018B8C91TM",
          "rich_text": [
            {
              "type": "rich_text",
              "elements": [
                {
                  "type": "rich_text_section",
                  "elements": [
                    {
                      "type": "text",
                      "text": "Timestream Defenders Orion"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }


### With initial date, select, and user fields​


    {
      "token": "***",
      "list_id": "F1234ABCD",
      "initial_fields": [
        {
          "column_id": "Col018AL764AE",
          "date": ["2025-10-10"]
        },
        {
          "column_id": "Col018AL7649G",
          "select": ["completed"]
        },
        {
          "column_id": "Col018B8C91V1",
          "user": ["U012A34BCDE"]
        }
      ]
    }


### Duplicate an item​

Create a copy of an existing item by specifying the `duplicated_item_id`:


    {
      "token": "***",
      "list_id": "F1234ABCD",
      "duplicated_item_id": "Rec12345678"
    }


### Create a subtask under a parent item​

Create a subtask by specifying the `parent_item_id`:


    {
      "token": "***",
      "list_id": "F1234ABCD",
      "parent_item_id": "Rec12345678",
      "initial_fields": [
        {
          "column_id": "Col10000000",
          "select": ["OptHIGH123"]
