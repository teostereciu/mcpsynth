## Usage info​

This method is only available for [workflow apps](/workflows).

In order to use this method, you must first obtain a service token via the Slack CLI.

Refer to [obtaining a service token](/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-mac-and-linux#obtain-token) for more details.

## Using activities​

This method returns the latest logs for a given `app_id`.

Note that if multiple filters are used, filtering will be performed with a logical 'and' operator.## Event type definitions

Each event type have some subtleties which are documented here. For example some event type might carry a different meaning based on the log level. The content of the `payload` object for each `activity` in the `activities[]` array is also dependent on the `event_type`.
