**Defines a way to group options in a menu.**

The menu can be a [select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/select-menu-element) or a [multi-select menu](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/multi-select-menu-element). An `option_groups` array can have a maximum number of 100 option groups with a maximum of 100 options.

#### Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `label`| Object| A `plain_text` text object that defines the label shown above this group of options. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 75 characters.| Required| `options`| Object[]| An array of option objects that belong to this specific group. Maximum of 100 items.| Required
---|---|---|---

#### Example​

The option group object must be used with the [select](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/select-menu-element) menu element or the [multi-select](/reference/block-kit/block-elements/multi-select-menu-element) menu element. This example shows a static select menu containing the option group object.
