## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`canvas_id`** Required

Encoded ID of the canvas

 _Example:_`F1234ABCD`

**`access_level`** Required

Desired level of access

 _Acceptable values:_`read` `write` `owner`

### Optional arguments

**`channel_ids`**`array`Optional

List of channels you wish to update access for. Can only be used if user_ids is not provided.

_Example:_`["C1234ABCD"]`

**`user_ids`**`array`Optional

List of users you wish to update access for. Can only be used if channel_ids is not provided.

_Example:_`["U1234ABCD"]`

## Usage info​

Canvases are only available to Slack workspaces on a paid plan.

The `canvases.access.set` method sets the access level to a canvas for specified entities. Call the `canvases.access.set` method to establish and set the desired access level for the canvas.

Both `channel_ids` and `user_ids` cannot be passed at the same time.

The possible `access_level` values are as follows:

  * `read`: grants read access to the canvas.
  * `write`: grants read and write access to the canvas.
  * `owner`: makes the specified user in `user_ids` the owner. If `channel_ids` is provided with this access level, the API method will return an `invalid_arguments` error because only users can be owners. Only the current file owner can set another user as the owner. Upgrades to the owner level for users from a different team than the one the canvas belongs to is not allowed.


Share the canvas link in the channel or with the user you are trying to set access levels for, respectively. For instance, if you are passing the `user_ids` argument to update a specific user's access, you must have sent the user the canvas directly _first_. Even if the user is a member of a channel where the canvas has been shared, calling the `canvases.access.set` method with a `user_ids` argument will fail. Since the permissions are set at the channel level, they must also be changed at the channel level.

### Sharing canvases via DM or MPDM​

Access levels can only be set for regular channels. Channel IDs associated with direct messages (DMs) or multi-party direct messages (MPDMs) will not be accepted and will result in an unsuccessful request. For sharing a canvas to DMs or MPDMs, use individual user IDs instead.
