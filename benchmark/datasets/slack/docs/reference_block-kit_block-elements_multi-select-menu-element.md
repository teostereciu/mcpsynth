# Multi-select menu element

*Source: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/block-kit/block-elements/multi-select-menu-element*

---

## Usage info​

_Interactive component_ \- see our [guide to enabling interactivity](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction).

Just like regular select menus, multi-select menus also include type-ahead functionality, where a user can type a part or all of an option string to filter the list.

There are different types of multi-select menu that depend on different data sources for their lists of options:

  * Menu with static options
  * Menu with external data source
  * Menu with user list
  * Menu with conversations list
  * Menu with channels list


Example:

## Static options​

This is the most basic form of select menu, with a static list of options passed in when defining the element.

### Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `multi_static_select`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action triggered when a menu option is selected. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/messaging/creating-interactive-messages#understanding_payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Optional| `options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object). Maximum number of options is 100. Each option must be less than 76 characters. If `option_groups` is specified, this field should not be.| Required| `option_groups`| Object[]| An array of [option group objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-group-object). Maximum number of option groups is 100. If `options` is specified, this field should not be.| Optional| `initial_options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object) that exactly match one or more of the options within `options` or `option_groups`. These options will be selected when the menu initially loads.| Optional| `confirm`| Object| A [confirm object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears before the multi-select choices are submitted.| Optional| `max_selected_items`| Integer| Specifies the maximum number of items that can be selected in the menu. Minimum number is 1.| Optional| `focus_on_load`| Boolean| Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](/reference/views). Only one element can be set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.| Optional| `placeholder`| Object| A [`plain_text` only text object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object) that defines the placeholder text shown on the menu. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 150 characters.| Optional
---|---|---|---

### Example​

The multi-select menu element must be used inside of the [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a static multi-select menu:


    {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "section",
                "block_id": "section678",
                "text": {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": "Pick items from the list"
                },
                "accessory": {
                    "action_id": "text1234",
                    "type": "multi_static_select",
                    "placeholder": {
                        "type": "plain_text",
                        "text": "Select items"
                    },
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
                            },
                            "value": "value-0"
                        },
                        {
                            "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
                            },
                            "value": "value-1"
                        },
                        {
                            "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
                            },
                            "value": "value-2"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }

## External data source​

This menu will load its options from an external data source, allowing for a dynamic list of options.

### Setup​

To use this menu type, you'll need to configure your app first:

  1. Go to your [app's settings page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Interactivity & Shortcuts** from the sidebar.
  2. Add a URL to the **Options Load URL** under Select Menus.
  3. Save changes.


Each time a menu of this type is opened or the user starts typing in the typeahead field, we'll send a request to your specified URL. Your app should return an HTTP 200 OK response, along with an `application/json` post body with an object containing either:

  * an [`options`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object) array
  * an [`option_groups`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-group-object) array


The `option_groups` array can have a maximum number of 100 option groups with a maximum of 100 options.

Here's an example response:


    {
      "options": [
        {
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
          },
          "value": "value-0"
        },
        {
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
          },
          "value": "value-1"
        },
        {
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "*this is plain_text text*"
          },
          "value": "value-2"
        }
      ]
    }


### Making the element optional​

By default, external multi-select menu elements require a user to select at least one option from the drop-down menu. However, there is a way to make a selection from this element optional. This is done by containing the element within an [input block](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block), and using its `optional` field to designate the input element as an optional element. (In fact, any Block Kit element can be made optional this way!)

### Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `multi_external_select`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action triggered when a menu option is selected. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Optional| `min_query_length`| Integer| When the typeahead field is used, a request will be sent on every character change. If you prefer fewer requests or more fully ideated queries, use the `min_query_length` attribute to tell Slack the fewest number of typed characters required before dispatch. The default value is `3`.| Optional| `initial_options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object) that exactly match one or more of the options within `options` or `option_groups`. These options will be selected when the menu initially loads.| Optional| `confirm`| Object| A [confirm object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears before the multi-select choices are submitted.| Optional| `max_selected_items`| Integer| Specifies the maximum number of items that can be selected in the menu. Minimum number is 1.| Optional| `placeholder`| Object| A [`plain_text`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object) only text object that defines the placeholder text shown on the menu. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 150 characters.| Optional
