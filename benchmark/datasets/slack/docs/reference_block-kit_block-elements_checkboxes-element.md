## Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `checkboxes`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action triggered when the checkbox group is changed. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Optional| `options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object). A maximum of 10 options are allowed.| Required| `initial_options`| Object[]| An array of [option objects](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/option-object) that exactly matches one or more of the options within `options`. These options will be selected when the checkbox group initially loads.| Optional| `confirm`| Object| A [confirm object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears after clicking one of the checkboxes in this element.| Optional| `focus_on_load`| Boolean| Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](/reference/views).

## Example​

The checkboxes element must be used inside the [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a group of checkboxes:
