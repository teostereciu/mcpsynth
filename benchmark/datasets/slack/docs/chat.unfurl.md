## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

### Optional arguments

**`channel`**`string`Optional

Channel ID of the message. Both `channel` and `ts` must be provided together, _or_ `unfurl_id` and `source` must be provided together.

**`ts`**`string`Optional

Timestamp of the message to add unfurl behavior to.

**`unfurls`**`string`Optional

URL-encoded JSON map with keys set to URLs featured in the the message, pointing to their unfurl blocks or message attachments. Either `unfurls` or `metadata` must be provided.

**`user_auth_message`** Optional

Provide a simply-formatted string to send as an ephemeral message to the user as invitation to authenticate further and enable full unfurling behavior. Provides two buttons, `Not now` or `Never ask me again`.

**`user_auth_required`**`boolean`Optional

Set to `true` or `1` to indicate the user must install your Slack app to trigger unfurls for this domain

 _Default:_`0`

**`user_auth_url`** Optional

Send users to this custom URL where they will complete authentication in your app to fully trigger unfurling. Value should be properly URL-encoded.

_Example:_`https://example.com/onboarding?user_id=xxx`

**`user_auth_blocks`** Optional

Provide a JSON based array of structured blocks presented as URL-encoded string to send as an ephemeral message to the user as invitation to authenticate further and enable full unfurling behavior

**`unfurl_id`**`string`Optional

The ID of the link to unfurl. Both `unfurl_id` and `source` must be provided together, _or_ `channel` and `ts` must be provided together.

_Example:_`Uxxxxxxx-909b5454-75f8-4ac4-b325-1b40e230bbd8`

**`source`**`string`Optional

The source of the link to unfurl. The source may either be `composer`, when the link is inside the message composer, or `conversations_history`, when the link has been posted to a conversation.

_Acceptable values:_`composer` `conversations_history`

 _Example:_`composer`

**`metadata`** Optional

JSON object with an entities field providing an array of Work Object entities. Either unfurls or metadata must be provided.

## Usage info​

This method [unfurls](/messaging/unfurling-links-in-messages#slack_app_unfurling) a link—either in the message composer or in a posted message.

Ensure that the `links:write` scope is added to your [**app settings**](https://api.slack.com/apps) for apps that will be performing app unfurling.

This method supports both granular bot and user tokens. The bot token is recommended.

Both `unfurl_id` and `source` must be provided together, _or_ `channel` and `ts` must be provided together.

The first time this method is executed with a particular `ts` and `channel` (or `unfurl_id` and `source`) combination, the valid `unfurls` attachments you provide will be attached to the message. Subsequent attempts with the same `ts` and `channel` values will modify the same attachments, rather than adding more.

The `ts` value you supply must correspond to a message in the specified `channel`. Also, the message must contain a fully-qualified URL pointing to a domain that is already registered and associated with your Slack app.

The `user_auth_required` parameter is optional. By providing a `1` or `true` value, it will require the user posting the link first authenticate themselves with your app. See also the [authenticated unfurling docs](/messaging/unfurling-links-in-messages#authenticated_unfurls).

If you'd rather directly point users to a specific page on your server to authenticate, pass a valid URL using the `user_auth_url` parameter. When sending this parameter via `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` GETs or POSTs, values must be URL-encoded such that `https://example.com/onboarding?user_id=xxx` becomes `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fonboarding%3Fuser_id%3Dxxx`.

Or, you can send an ephemeral message to that user by providing a simple string-based `user_auth_message` value or JSON array of blocks using `user_auth_blocks`. [Simple slack message formatting](/messaging/formatting-message-text) like `*bold*`, `_italics_`, and linking is supported, so you can wrap your custom URLs in a blanket of situationally accurate, actionable text.

`user_auth_message` offers two default buttons, `Not now` and `Never ask me again` which allows your app to prompt a user multiple times before opting out of an install. To make your ephemeral message extra fancy, you can also use `user_auth_blocks` which will override the default buttons. Using both properties shows the `user_auth_message` in a notification and the `user_auth_blocks` in the ephemeral message.

Specifying `user_auth_url` or `user_auth_message` will automatically imply `user_auth_required` being set to `true`. If both `user_auth_url` and `user_auth_message` are provided, `user_auth_message` takes precedence.

### The `unfurls` parameter​

The `unfurls` parameter expects a URL-encoded string of JSON. Unlike [`chat.postMessage`](/reference/methods/chat.postMessage)'s `attachments` parameter, it does not expect a JSON array but instead, a hash keyed on the specific URLs you're offering an unfurl for. Each URL can have a [single attachment](/messaging/formatting-message-text), including message buttons.

You can define your own preview for a link that you're unfurling inside the message composer by passing the `preview` field:


    "unfurls": {
      "https://example.com": {
        "blocks": [...],
        "preview": {
            "title": {
              "type": "plain_text",
              "text": "custom preview"
            },
            "icon_url":
              "https://images.pexels.com/photos/774731/pexels-photo-774731.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500"
          }
        }
    }


This `preview` field is optional, however, if `preview` and `title` are not provided, Canvas app unfurls will be unable to render title text. In the absence of `preview` for uses outside of Canvas, we will generate the preview based on the blocks layout or legacy attachment. If the preview is provided in an unfurl for a **posted message** , rather than a link inside the message composer, we will simply ignore this property.

Read the [unfurling](/messaging/unfurling-links-in-messages#slack_app_unfurling) docs for [more guidance](/messaging/unfurling-links-in-messages#unfurls_parameter) on this parameter.

For use specifically with a file unfurl, you can set the `hide_color` field to `true` to remove the color bar from a message as in the following example:


    "unfurls": {
      "https://example.com": {
        "hide_color": true,
        "blocks": [{
          "type": "file",
          "external_id": "ABCD1",
          "source": "remote",
        }]
      }
    }


This property works only with a file block; if this property is included along with other blocks (for example, a section block), this method will throw an error.

### The `metadata` parameter​

The `metadata` parameter expects a JSON object with `entity_type` and `entity_payload` fields, presented as a URL-encoded string. Either `unfurls` or `metadata` must be provided. Slack uses this parameter to generate a Work Object representing the resource your app is unfurling. The JSON schema of the parameter is found below:


    "metadata": {
      "entities": [
        {
          "app_unfurl_url": "https://example.com/document/123?eid=123456&edit=abcxyz",
          // URL posted by the user in a conversation
          "url": "https://example.com/document/123",
          // URL representing the resource in the third party system
          "external_ref": {
            "id": "123", // a string ID that uniquely identifies the resource being unfurled
            "type": "document" // An optional internal type for entity in the source system.
            // Only needed if the ID is not globally unique or needed when retrieving the item.
          },
          "entity_type": "slack#/entities/file", // entity type
          "entity_payload": {}, // entity schema
        }
      ]
    }

## Response​

####

Typical, minimal success response


    {
      "ok": true
    }


####

Typical error response


    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "cannot_unfurl_url"
    }


As you can see, we provide a minimal positive response when your unfurl attempt is successful. When it is not, you'll receive one of the errors below and `ok` will be `false`.
