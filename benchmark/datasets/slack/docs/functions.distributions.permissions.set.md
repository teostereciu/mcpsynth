## Usage info​

Set the `permission_type` to define how your custom function can be [distributed](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/controlling-access-to-custom-functions) for use in other workflows. Supply a list of user IDs to grant access to if distributing to a specific group of users.

Identify your function by supplying its callback ID and your app ID. The encoded ID of the function can also be used instead.

## Response​

####

If successful, the command returns the permission type and if applicable, the list of users with access


    {
      "ok": true,
      "permission_type": "app_collaborators",
      "users": [
        {
          "user_id": "U01565LTEBD",
          "username": "joe_smith",
          "email": "joesmith@salesforce.com"
