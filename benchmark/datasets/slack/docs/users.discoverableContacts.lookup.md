This API method _only_ returns info on whether there is a discoverable Slack user associated with an email address. No other information about the user is returned.

Both users and organizations can opt out of Slack Connect discoverability. [See the help center for more instruction.](https://slack.com/help/articles/5535749574803-Manage-Slack-Connect-discoverability-for-your-organization)

Use this method when you want to only verify email addresses, or when you want to limit the exposure of user information.

If you _do_ want to return the user's information, use the [`users.lookupByEmail`](/reference/methods/users.lookupByEmail) method to return the [user object](/reference/objects/user-object).
