# Group

For information about private channels, refer to [conversation objects](/reference/objects/conversation-object).

The [Conversations API](/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api) will tell you whether a conversation is private or not with the `is_private` boolean field.

For posterity, a group object contains information about a private channel that was created before March 2021. The private channel's ID will begin with `G`, as private channels were previously known as "private groups."

An example response is below:


    {
        "id": "G123456",
        "name": "secretplans",
        "is_group": "true",
        "created": 1360782804,
        "creator": "U123456",
        "is_archived": false,
        "is_mpim": false,
        "members": [
            "U012AB3CD"
        ],
        "topic": {
            "value": "Secret plans on hold",
            "creator": "U123456",
            "last_set": 1369677212
        },
        "purpose": {
            "value": "Discuss secret plans that nobody else should know",
            "creator": "U123456",
            "last_set": 1360782804
        },
        "last_read": "1401383885.000061",
        "latest": {},
        "unread_count": 0,
        "unread_count_display": 0
    }


## Group object fields​

Field| Type| Description| `id`| string| The ID of the private channel.| `name`| string| The name of the private channel.| `is_group`| boolean| Whether this object is a conversation.| `created`| Unix timestamp| When the conversation was created.| `creator`| string| The user ID of the member that created this private channel.| `is_archived`| boolean| `true` if the private channel is archived.| `is_mpim`| boolean| Whether a multiparty instant message (`mpim`) is being emulated as a private channel. For compatibility with older clients, `mpims` can appear as private channels unless `rtm.start` is called with `mpim_aware=1`.| `members`| array| A list of user IDs for all users in this private channel. This includes any disabled accounts that were in this private channel when they were disabled.| `topic`| object| The topic of the conversation.| `purpose`| object| The purpose of the conversation.

Some API methods (such as [conversations.create](/reference/methods/conversations.create)) will include extra state information for channels when the calling user is a member:

  * `last_read`: the Unix timestamp for the last message the calling user has read in this channel.
  * `unread_count`: a full count of visible messages that the calling user has yet to read.
  * `unread_count_display`: a count of messages that the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (this means it excludes things like join/leave messages).
  * `latest`: the latest message in the channel.
