`application/json`

**Rate Limits**[Special rate limits apply.](/apis/web-api/rate-limits)

## Arguments​

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_`xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`event_context`**`string`Required

### Optional arguments

**`cursor`**`string`Optional

**`limit`**`integer`Optional

## Usage info​

This method returns a list of authorizations for the given event specified by `event_context`. Each authorization represents an app installation that the event is visible to.

### How do I find an `event_context` to call this method with?​

You'll receive an `event_context` identifying an event in each [event payload](/apis/events-api/#begin) sent to your app. However, [not all events contain an `event_context`](/changelog/2020-09-15-events-api-truncate-authed-users#full_list).

### What do authorizations signify?​

Authorizations are **installations of your app**. If your app has been installed multiple times, you'll probably have multiple authorizations for some events.

### When should I call this method?​

Call this method to see all the installations of your app than an event is visible to. Sometimes, only certain installations have permission to know about an event.

### How do I get permission to call this method​

Calling this method is just like any other [Web API](/apis/web-api/) method. However, since this method lists **multiple installations** of your app, you'll need an [app-level token](/authentication/tokens#app).

You'll obtain the app-level token by going to your [app settings](https://api.slack.com/apps) and scrolling down to the App-Level Tokens section on the **Basic Information** page. CLick `Generate Token and Scopes` to get the token. You'll also request the [`authorizations:read`](/reference/scopes/authorizations.read) scope.

For this method, you will need to pass this token in the HTTP `Authorization` header of your request; passing it as a POST parameter will result in an error.

### What are the rate limiting conditions for this method?​

Rate limiting conditions for this method include a default rate limit that is sufficient for most apps, with custom overrides determined on a per-team basis. The default limit is 600 requests per minute (per app per team).
