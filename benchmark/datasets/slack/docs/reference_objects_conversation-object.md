# Conversation

*Source: https://docs.slack.dev/reference/objects/conversation-object*

---

A conversation object contains information about a channel-like thing in Slack. It might be a public channel, a private channel, a direct message, a multi-person direct message, or a huddle. You'll find all of these objects throughout the [Conversations API](/apis/web-api/using-the-conversations-api). Different fields are included in the object payload depending on the type of conversation (channel, DM, MPIM, etc.). The legacy objects—[channel](/reference/objects/channel-object), [group](/reference/objects/group-object), [im](/reference/objects/im-object), and [mpim](/reference/objects/mpim-object)—reference pages are nested under this one for posterity, but they are all now represented by the conversation object.

## Example responses​

An example response for the [`conversations.info`](/reference/methods/conversations.info) method is as follows:

## Conversation-related booleans​

Property| Description| `is_archived`| Indicates a conversation is archived, frozen in time.| `is_channel`| Indicates whether a conversation is a channel. Private channels created before March 2021 (with IDs that begin with `G`) will return `false`, and `is_group` will be `true` instead. Use `is_private` to determine whether a channel is private or public.| `is_ext_shared`| Indicates whether a conversation is part of a [Shared Channel](/apis/slack-connect/) with a remote organization. Your app should make sure the data it shares in such a channel is appropriate for both workspaces. `is_shared` will also be `true`.| `is_general`| Means the channel is the workspace's "general" discussion channel (even if it may not be named `#general`). That might be important to your app because almost every user is a member.| `is_group`| Means the channel is a private channel created before March 2021. `is_private` will also be `true`.| `is_im`| Means the conversation is a direct message between two distinguished individuals or a user and a bot. `is_private` will also be `true`.| `is_member`| Indicates whether the user, bot user or Slack app associated with the token making the API call is itself a member of the conversation.| `is_mpim`| Represents an unnamed private conversation between multiple users. `is_private` will also be `true`.| `is_org_shared`| Indicates whether this shared channel is shared between [Enterprise organization](/enterprise) workspaces within the same organization. It's a little different from (_externally_) [Shared Channels](/apis/slack-connect/), yet `is_shared` will be `true`.| `is_pending_ext_shared`| Means the conversation is ready to become an `is_ext_shared` channel, but needs some kind of approval or sign off first. Best to treat it as if it were a shared channel, even if it traverses only one workspace.| `is_private`| Means the conversation is privileged between two or more members. Ensure that you meet their privacy expectations.| `is_read_only`| Means the conversation can't be written to by the user performing the API call.| `is_shared`| Means the conversation is in some way shared between multiple workspaces. Look for `is_ext_shared` and `is_org_shared` to learn which kind it is, and if that matters, act accordingly.| `is_thread_only`| Means the conversation can't be written to by the user performing the API call, except to reply to messages in the channel.| `num_members`| The number of members in the conversation. `num_members` may not make an appearance in the response for conversation types like DMs, where the number of members is constant.
---|---

## Other conversation-related attributes​

Property| Type| Description| `name`| String| Indicates the name of the channel-like thing, without a leading hash sign. Don't get too attached to that name; it may change — instead, when working with channel-like things, focus on their IDs, their type, and the team/workspace they belong to.| `creator`| String| The ID of the member that created this conversation.| `created`| Int| Timestamp of when the conversation was created.| `conversation_host_id`| String| Appears on shared channel objects and indicates the "host" of the shared channel. The value may contain a workspace's ID (beginning with `T`) _or_ an Enterprise organization's ID (beginning with `E`).| `topic`| String| Provides information about the channel topic.| `purpose`| String| Provides information about the channel purpose.| `updated`| Int| The timestamp, in milliseconds, when the channel settings were updated — for example, the "topic" or "description" of the channel changed.
---|---|---

Some API methods; for example, [`conversations.join`](/reference/methods/conversations.join), can include extra state information for channels when the calling user is a member:

Property| Type| Description| `last_read`| Int| The timestamp for the last message the calling user has read in this channel.| `unread_count`| Int| A full count of visible messages that the calling user has yet to read.| `unread_count_display`| Int| A count of messages that the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (excludes things like join/leave messages).| `latest`| String| The latest message in the channel.| `properties`| Object| Additional channel properties (see below).
---|---|---

The `properties` object contains many additional fields that appear based on the context of the object.

Property| Type| Description| `posting_restricted_to`| Object| An object comprised of three arrays: `subteam`, `type`, and `user`, each offering a different way to restrict who can post in the channel.| `threads_restricted_to`| Object| An object comprised of three arrays: `subteam`, `type`, and `user`, each offering a different way to restrict who can post in threads in the channel.| `at_channel_restricted`| Boolean| Indicates if the `@channel` mention is restricted.| `at_here_restricted`| Boolean| Indicates if the `@here` mention is restricted.| `huddles_restricted`| Boolean| Indicates if huddles are restricted.| `sharing_disabled`| Boolean| Indicates if sharing is disabled.| `canvas`| Object| The channel canvas.| `record_channel`| Object| Properties for Salesforce channels.| `crm`| Object| Properties for Slack CRM.| `workflow`| Object| Properties for a workflow; currently contains one field, `primary_workflow_url`.| `tabs`| Object| List of channel tabs. Each tab has an `id`, `label`, `type`, `data`, and `is_disabled` property. Its `type` can be any of the following: `list`, `canvas`, `files`, `bookmarks`, `folder`, `pins`, `workflows`, `channel_canvas`, `record_list`, `record_overview`, `record_summary`, `record_related_list`,`salesforce_list_view`.| `huddles`| Object| Properties for huddles for the channel the huddle occurred in.| `membership_limit`| Integer| Limit of users in channel.| `channel_workflows`| Array| An array of workflows in the channel.| `channel_solutions`| Object| Properties for channel solutions: `workflow_trigger_ids`, `workflow_workflow_ids`, `canvas_ids`, `list_ids`.| `default_tab_id`| String| Indicates which tab in the channel is the default.| `auto_open_tab_id`| String| Indicates which tab in the channel auto opens.| `meeting_notes`| Object| Properties for channel meeting notes.
---|---|---

These channel objects are not the same object type as those for private channels created before March 2021, which are considered [group objects](/reference/objects/group-object).
