## Usage info​

Use the `chat.appendStream` method to append text to a stream started with the [`chat.startStream`](/reference/methods/chat.startStream) method. When there is no more text to append, stop the stream with the [`chat.stopStream`](/reference/methods/chat.stopStream) method.

The Python Slack SDK and Node Slack SDK both provide a helper utility for the `chat.*Stream` methods that are surfaced in [Bolt for Python](/tools/bolt-python/concepts/message-sending) and [Bolt for JavaScript](/tools/bolt-js/concepts/message-sending).

### Using the `chunks` parameter​

The `chunks` parameter can include markdown text chunk objects, task update chunk objects, or plan update chunks.

#### `markdown_text` chunks​

The `markdown_text` chunk is used for streaming text content with markdown formatting support.


    {
      "type": "markdown_text",
      "text": "We love Sandra"
    }


#### `task_update` chunks​

The `task_update` chunk object looks mighty similar to the [task card block](/reference/block-kit/blocks/task-card-block)!

The `task_update` chunk is used for displaying task progress in a timeline-style UI.


    {
      "type": "task_update",
      "id": "unique_task_id",
      "title": "Remind Sandra how amazing she is",
      "status": "pending" | "in_progress" | "complete" | "error",
      "details": "wow such good details",
      "output": "amazing output here",
      "sources": [
          {
          "type": "url",
          "text": "Example.com",
          "url": "https://example.com"
        }
      ]
    }


#### `plan_update` chunks​

The `plan_update` chunk is used for updating the title of a plan.


    {
      "type": "plan_update",
      "title": "Sandra's new and improved plan"
    }


The character limit for chunk sizes for `task_update` and `plan_update` is 256 characters.
