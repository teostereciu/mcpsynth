## Example​

The date picker element must be used inside the [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a date picker element:


    {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "section",
                "block_id": "section1234",
                "text": {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": "Pick a date for the deadline."
                },
                "accessory": {
                    "type": "datepicker",
                    "action_id": "datepicker123",
                    "initial_date": "1990-04-28",
                    "placeholder": {
                        "type": "plain_text",
                        "text": "Select a date"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
