## Usage info​

_Interactive component_ \- see our [guide to enabling interactivity](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction).

On desktop clients, this time picker will take the form of a dropdown list with free-text entry for precise choices. On mobile clients, the time picker will use native time picker UIs.

## Fields​

Field| Type| Description| Required?| `type`| String| The type of element. In this case `type` is always `timepicker`.| Required| `action_id`| String| An identifier for the action triggered when a time is selected. You can use this when you receive an interaction payload to [identify the source of the action](/interactivity/handling-user-interaction#payloads). Should be unique among all other `action_id`s in the containing block. Maximum length is 255 characters.| Optional| `initial_time`| String| The initial time that is selected when the element is loaded. This should be in the format `HH:mm`, where `HH` is the 24-hour format of an hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is minutes with leading zeros (00 to 59), for example `22:25` for 10:25pm.| Optional| `confirm`| Object| A [confirm object](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/confirmation-dialog-object) that defines an optional confirmation dialog that appears after a time is selected.| Optional| `focus_on_load`| Boolean| Indicates whether the element will be set to auto focus within the [`view object`](/reference/views). Only one element can be set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.| Optional| `placeholder`| Object| A [`plain_text`](/reference/block-kit/composition-objects/text-object) only text object that defines the placeholder text shown on the time picker. Maximum length for the `text` in this field is 150 characters.| Optional| `timezone`| String| A string in the IANA format, e.g. "America/Chicago". The timezone is displayed to end users as hint text underneath the time picker. It is also passed to the app upon certain interactions, such as `view_submission`.| Optional

## Example​

The time picker element must be used inside of the [section](/reference/block-kit/blocks/section-block) block, [actions](/reference/block-kit/blocks/actions-block) block, or [input](/reference/block-kit/blocks/input-block) block. This example shows a section block containing a time picker element, with the initial time set to 11:40am:


    {
        "blocks": [
            {
                "type": "section",
                "block_id": "section1234",
                "text": {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": "Pick a date for the deadline."
                },
                "accessory": {
                    "type": "timepicker",
                    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
                    "action_id": "timepicker123",
                    "initial_time": "11:40",
                    "placeholder": {
                        "type": "plain_text",
                        "text": "Select a time"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
