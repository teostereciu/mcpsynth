## Usage info​

This method disconnects [Slack Connect](https://slack.com/help/articles/115004151203-Slack-Connect-guide--work-with-external-organizations) channels and direct messages (DMs) from an organization to end all communication with them. Disconnecting from an organization ends all communication, but depending on permissions, still allows access to conversation history. Refer to [this help center article](https://slack.com/help/articles/360063030933-Slack-Connect--Disconnect-from-an-organization-#:~:text=Below%20Administration%20in%20the%20left,%5D%2C%20then%20Disconnect%20to%20confirm) for the expected behavior of disconnecting a channel, MPDM, or DM.

Example request:


    {
      "target_team": "T123ABCDEF"
    }


Note that the disconnect process occurs in the background and may take some time to complete.

### Use cases​

This method may be useful for:

  * Automating compliance—automatically disconnect from organizations that no longer meet your compliance or security standards.

  * Streamlining management—integrate disconnection into on-boarding/off-boarding processes for seamless management of external collaborations.

  * Routine maintenance—schedule regular audits and disconnections as part of your organization's routine maintenance tasks.
