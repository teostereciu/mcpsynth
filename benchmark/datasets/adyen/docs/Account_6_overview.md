# Account API
This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to ournew integration guideinstead.
The Account API provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on your platform. These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and verification-related documents. The management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.
For more information, refer to ourdocumentation.

## Authentication
Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add anX-API-Keyheader with the API key as the value, for example:

```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
...
```

```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
...
```
Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

```
curl
-U "ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
...
```

```
curl
-U "ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
...
```
When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access thelive endpoints.

## Versioning
The Account API supportsversioningusing a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.
For example:

```
https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v6/createAccountHolder
```

```
https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v6/createAccountHolder
```
