# Open Banking API
The Open Banking API provides secure endpoints to share financial data and services with third parties. This API offers quick and reliable user verification.
With these endpoints, you can:
- Create a list of available account verification routes: Create a list of Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) for third-party individual account verification. Successful connections generate a unique code used for requesting bank reports and verifying identity.
- Verify bank account ownership: Get the account verification report using the unique code from a successful open banking connection. This report provides identity verification and bank account details.

## Authentication
Each request made to the Open Banking API must be signed with an API key. Generate an API key in your Customer Area.
To connect to the API, add an X-API-Keyheader with the API key as the value, for example:

```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" 
...
```

```
curl
-H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" 
...
```
