# Summary
With creators at the heart of TikTok as a platform and a proven resource to drive trust, awareness and purchases for brands, affiliate collaborations are the perfect blend between creator-driven video content and social commerce.
TikTok Shop has officially launched a new category of Affiliate APIs designed around **creator affiliate marketing**, enabling development partners to help drive new monetization avenues for TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates (hereinafter referred to as creators) and enhance workflows and growth opportunities for brands and sellers alike.
Development partners can integrate with the TikTok Shop Affiliate APIs to help TikTok Shop stakeholders **create, manage, matchmake, track, monetize, and collaborate across TikTok Shop Affiliate Collaborations and Partner Campaigns**. Listing an Affiliate API integrated app within the TikTok Shop App Store offers development partners numerous advantages:

* **Support for Existing Customers**: Satisfy and support your existing customers who are already on TikTok Shop or will be joining soon.
* **Increased Exposure**: Gain visibility among TikTok Shop sellers looking for affiliate solutions within the app store.
* **Marketing Opportunities**: Benefit from inclusion in marketing initiatives related to the TikTok Shop App Store.
* **Competitive Differentiation**: Stand out from competitors that are not integrated with TikTok Shop.
* **Enhanced Revenue Generation**: Provide a down-funnel, measurable solution that focuses on performance and revenue generation, beyond just top-of-funnel awareness and engagement marketing.
