# US, UK, and SEA markets: Pre-order and made-to-order product types

*Source: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/us-uk-and-sea-markets-pre-order-and-made-to-order-product-types*

---

## Summary
We're introducing a couple of new `pre_sale` product types to better support TikTok Shop seller needs. There are a couple key business logic distinctions based on the market, as follows:

For the **US** market, this includes pre-order and made-to-order products:

* **Pre-order**: The buyer can place an order for a product before a **fixed** release date set by the seller.
* **Made-to-order**: The buyer can place an order for a customized product that is made-to-order. The shipping lead time depends on the order placement date/time, as well as the production time required for each individual order, rather than a fixed release date.
* **Custom**: The seller can select a specific SKU and set a handling time that's longer than the platform policy of 3 business days. The estimated delivery time and late dispatch evaluation will be based on the handling time set.

For the **UK** and **SEA** markets, this is currently limited to pre-order products only:

* **Pre-order**: The buyer can place an order for a product before release, but the shipping lead time depends on the order placement date/time and the production time required for each individual order, rather than a fixed release date.
