### Fulfillment APIs
#### Local sellers
By default, local sellers in the Japan market should follow the seller shipping (3PL) workflow (see the [Fulfillment API overview](fulfillment-api-overview) for more details). Sellers must use the following integrated carriers for shipping:

* Yamato
* Sagawa Express
* Japan Post
* Seino Transportation
* Seino Super Express

For local sellers, the seller shipping workflow should generally follow these steps:

1. The seller ships the package and obtains the shipment tracking number from the shipping carrier.
2. Use the [Get Shipping Providers](get-shipping-providers) endpoint to retrieve the shipping service provider IDs supported by TikTok Shop.
3. Use the [Mark Package as Shipped](mark-package-as-shipped) endpoint to upload the tracking number and shipping provider ID.

#### China cross-border (GS-POP) sellers
China cross-border sellers should use the following fulfillment workflows:
| **Shipping type** | **Endpoint(s)** |
| --- | --- |
| Oversea warehouse | 1. The seller ships the package and obtains the shipment tracking number from the shipping carrier. <br> 2. Use the [Get Shipping Providers](get-shipping-providers) endpoint to retrieve the shipping service provider IDs supported by TikTok Shop. <br> 3. Use the [Mark Package as Shipped](mark-package-as-shipped) endpoint to upload the tracking number and shipping provider ID. |
| Direct shipping | 1. The seller schedules the package handover time and method with the shipping provider. <br> 2. Use the [Ship Package](ship-package) endpoint to schedule the package handover time and method. <br> 3. Use the [Get Package Shipping Document](get-package-shipping-document) endpoint to get the shipping label. |
