# Draft editing support for published listings

---

## Summary
Previously, the TikTok Shop Seller Center only allowed draft editing prior to publishing a listing. We've recently expanded this feature to additionally enable sellers to edit and save drafts for products that have already been listed, and are now ensuring it is reflected in our APIs.
