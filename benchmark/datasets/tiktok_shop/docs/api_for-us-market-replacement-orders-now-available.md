# For US market: Replacement orders now available

# Summary
Prior to releasing this new feature, the only choice available to buyers who received missing, damaged or otherwise compromised items in an order was to request a return or refund. To improve the buyer experience and help sellers provide better customer satisfaction, TikTok Shop has released a new feature where a buyer can ask for a replacement for the item they paid for. Sellers can approve the request for replacement and send them a new item by creating a new "Replacement" order. If the seller does not want to provide replacements, the request can be canceled and issue a refund instead.
**This change is only for the US market and affects local sellers. Developers who build return apps, connector apps, or multi-channel apps are** <span style="color: rgb(222, 120, 2)"><strong>recommended</strong></span> **to adopt this change.**
