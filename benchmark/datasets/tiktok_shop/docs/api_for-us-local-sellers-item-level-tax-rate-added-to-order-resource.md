# What is changing?
We've introduced a new `tax_rate` property for the Order resource. This `tax_rate` represents the item's tax rate within an order, calculated by TikTok Shop. Factors influencing this rate include US Sales Tax regulations and the product's category.
Developers can access the `tax_rate` in version 202309 of the Get Order List and Get Order Detail API. For example:

* API request path: `/order/202309/orders`
* API response:

```JSON
{
    "code": 0,
    "data": {
        "orders": [
            {
                "line_items": [
                    {
                        "display_status": "TO_SHIP",
                        "id": "577086512123755123",
                        "is_gift": false,
                        "item_tax": [
                            {
                                "tax_amount": "21.2",
                                "tax_type": "SALES_TAX",
                                "tax_rate": "0.03"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "message": "Success",
    "request_id": "202203070749000101890810281E8C70B7"
}
```
