# (18) Product category change

*Source: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/18-product-category-change*

---

# 1. Trigger scenario
When the category of a product is changed, all apps authorized by the shop (using `shop_id`) receive this webhook. When you receive the webhook, you can get more detailed product information by using the [Get Product](get-product) API.
This webhook is triggered regardless of how a product category is changed. Categories can be changed by the seller, developer, or TikTok Shop.
