# For local sellers in the US market: Warning information added to Mark Package as Shipped API

*Source: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/for-local-sellers-in-us-market-warning-information-added-to-mark-package-as-shipped-api*

---

# What is changing?
We added a new `warning` component to the [Mark Package As Shipped](mark-package-as-shipped) API. The new component includes the following field:

* `message`: TikTok Shop validates the `tracking number` value and returns a warning message if it detects any issues, such as:
   * The value does not match any shipping provider.
   * The value matches multiple shipping providers.
   * The value matches a different `shipping_provider_id` than what you passed via the API parameter.

The `message` field might contain the following warning messages:
| Message |
| --- |
| Verifying order tracking number timeout. Please ensure your tracking number and logistics provider is correct. |
| No logistics provider could be found for this tracking number. Check the tracking number and try again. |
| The tracking number you entered matches multiple logistics providers. Ensure you select the correct logistics provider. |
| No logistics provider or service could be found for this tracking number. Check the tracking number and try again. |
| The tracking number you entered does not match your selected logistics provider. Check the tracking number and logistics provider. Did you mean to select {{inferred_provider_name}}? |
