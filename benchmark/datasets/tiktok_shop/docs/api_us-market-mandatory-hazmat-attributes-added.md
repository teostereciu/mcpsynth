# US market: Mandatory hazmat attributes added

# Summary
## What are we launching
A dangerous good (also known as hazardous material or hazmat) is any product capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property during shipping, storage, and handling. These goods can contain flammable, corrosive, pressurized, or otherwise harmful substances. As a result, dangerous goods must be handled and transported with special care and safety measures and can have additional transportation requirements (such as specific marking and labeling of packages or special handling).
Sellers are responsible for identifying if their listed products qualify as dangerous goods and shipping and labeling these products in a compliant manner, according to applicable laws and regulations.
In order to do this, we are launching new required attributes to Get Attributes API. These attributes must be filled by the seller in order to list products in hazmat categories.

## When are we launching it
API enforcement for product listings (Create and Edit Product APIs) with hazmat attributes will begin after **++January 5th++**.
## Impact
