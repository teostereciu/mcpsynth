# **Mandatory Activation for All Apps in All Global Markets, Q1 2026**
To enhance buyer experience and improve overall order processing stability, TikTok Shop introduced a new order status — **“On Hold”** — effective **December 13, 2023**.
To ensure ecosystem-wide consistency, **TikTok Shop will automatically activate “On Hold” orders for all apps that have not yet enabled support starting in Q1 2026**.
This means:
**All apps that have not completed integration will begin receiving On Hold orders**, which may lead to fulfillment failures, missing address fields, and other processing issues.
Please complete the necessary updates as soon as possible to avoid disruption for your merchants.


---


# 1. What Is the “On Hold” Status?
“On Hold” is a new order status applied **after payment**, lasting **1 hour**. During this window:

* Buyers may cancel the order without seller approval
* Sellers cannot take any action on the order (e.g., print labels, ship packages)
* The API will return empty values for **full_address**, **recipient_address**, and **district_info**
* A new field **is_on_hold_order** is added in API v202309 to distinguish this flow

This update applies to **cross-border and local sellers**.


---


# 2. Why You Must Support It Now
Starting **Q1 2026**:

* All apps (including those not directly processing orders) **will be automatically enabled for On Hold orders**
* Apps that are *not* prepared may experience:
   * Fulfillment errors (Error Code 21011044)
   * Missing address data
   * Incorrect handling of the 1-hour customer remorse window
   * Merchant complaints and disrupted operations

**To avoid these risks, please complete your integration before Q1 2026.**

# 3. Required Developer Actions
### **3.1 - Upgrade to API v202309 (Strongly Recommended)**
Only v202309 includes the new field **is_on_hold_order**, which enables apps to correctly identify whether an order has passed the On Hold stage.
> Apps using legacy API versions cannot reliably process On Hold orders.


### **3.2 - Support Both Order Status Flows**
Depending on the shop and category, merchants may still receive **two types of order flows**:
| **Order Flow** | **Status Path** | **is_on_hold_order** | **Required Handling** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **New Flow** | `Unpaid` → `On Hold` → `Awaiting Shipment` | `TRUE` | Can fulfill immediately after status becomes `Awaiting Shipment` |
| **Existing Flow** | `Unpaid` → `Awaiting Shipment` | `FALSE` | Must hold the order for 1 hour before shipping |
Your app must support **both** flows in parallel.

### **3.3 - Complete the “On Hold Status Developer Declaration” in Partner Center**
After finishing development & testing:
Navigate to:
**Partner Center → App & Service → App Detail → On Hold Status Developer Declaration**
Click **“Declare”** to confirm support.
Once the declaration is completed:

* The “App does not support On Hold” warning will be removed
* The app will be marked as fully compatible
* Merchants can install the app without receiving warnings


### **3.4 - Test Using Sandbox 2.0**

* Sandbox 2.0 shops **always include On Hold** in eligible categories
* Some categories allow testing of the **existing** order flow (without On Hold)
* All developers should verify their app handles both flows correctly

# 4. Key Timeline
| **Timeframe** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Now – Q1 2026** | Developers must complete On Hold support + declaration |
| **Q1 2026** | TikTok Shop will activate On Hold orders for all non-compliant apps |
| **After activation** | Apps without support may fail to fulfill orders or return errors |

---


# 5. Impact / Potential Risks if Not Updated
If the app does not support On Hold before the enforcement date:

* **API error 21011044 will prevent shipment**
* **Missing address data may cause logistics failures**
* **Merchants may be unable to fulfill orders**
* **App installation pages will continue to show warning banners**
* **Increased merchant complaints and operational risk**
