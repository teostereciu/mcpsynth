# What is changing?
When using [Update Activity Product](update-activity-product) and [Remove Activity Product](remove-activity-product) endpoints, a list of product_id and sku_id parameters is passed to determine which products and SKUs are updated or removed for certain promotional activity.
Starting from **August 21, 2024**, we will enforce a limit of 300 SKUs and 300 products per API call for these two endpoints. Any API calls that exceed this limit will fail and return a specific error code "17029046".
# Which markets are affected?
The update applies to the local and cross-border sellers in **ALL** the markets
# Who is affected?
Developers with applications that use [Update Activity Product](update-activity-product) and [Remove Activity Product](remove-activity-product)
# Which version is applicable?
The limits apply to all versions of the related APIs
# What action is required?
Please ensure your usage complies with this new limit to avoid disruptions in service.
