# EU market: Pfand Fees and Packaging Type Data

*Source: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/gvt0yknn*

---

# Summary
A Pfand is a refundable deposit applied to certain products, typically beverage containers (e.g., bottles or cans), in countries with a deposit return system like Germany. The customer pays the deposit when purchasing the product and can reclaim it by returning the empty container to a designated return point. This system incentivizes recycling and proper disposal of packaging.

Packaging type refers to the specific kind of container material and reusability (e.g., single-use vs. multi-use) influence the deposit value and whether the packaging qualifies under the national deposit scheme.

From **October 13, 2025,** Pfand fee and packaging type fields will be available in the EU for select categories. They’ll be required only in Germany for now, but this may change in the future.

# Next steps

1. **Sync product category fields** with updated required attribute rules to avoid product creation and update errors.
2. **Pass and process** **`pfand_fee`** in your integration, ensuring safe handling of additional response fields.


*General recommendation: Product categories are updated frequently, so it's recommended to call the API in real time to ensure you are using the latest category data. Caching category data locally may result in using outdated information, leading to errors when creating products.
