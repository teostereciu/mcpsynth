# Updates to product errors

# **Summary**
To help developers identify and handle errors better, we've refined several ambiguous error codes by either splitting them into more precise error codes, or replacing them with more appropriate error codes. These changes provide clearer context on what went wrong. The error conditions remain the same, only the codes associated with them have changed for clarity.
