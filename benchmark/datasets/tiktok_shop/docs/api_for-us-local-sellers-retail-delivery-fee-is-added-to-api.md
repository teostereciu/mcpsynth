# What is changing?
The states of Colorado enacted a new retail delivery fee, with Minnesota introducing a similar policy effective July 2024.
To be compliant with these laws, TikTok Shop will collect retail delivery fees from CO & MN states' buyers and show retail delivery fees on the place order page and invoice. The estimated launch time will be beginning of October. The following APIs will reflect the change:
## Get Order List, Get Order Details
A new property, `retail_delivery_fee`is added to the API response.
## Search Cancellations
A new property `refund_retail_delivery_fee` (the retail delivery fee refunded to buyer) is added to the API response as part of the `refund_amount` and `cancel_line_items` object.
## Search Return
A new property `refund_retail_delivery_fee` (the retail delivery fee refunded to buyer) is added to the API response as part of the `refund_amount` and `return_line_items` object.
## Calculate Refund
A new property `refund_retail_delivery_fee` (the retail delivery fee refunded to buyer) is added to the API response, in the `order_refund_amount` object.
