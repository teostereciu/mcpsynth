# What is changing?
**Virtual bundles** is a TikTok Shop seller enablement initiative which allows sellers to create a new ProductID (new SKU) by adding multiple existing SKUs and allowing them to share the inventory in real-time. Sellers can set prices for the new SKUs different from the sums of the added SKUs. The new SKUs will become independent new products for shoppers to explore and purchase.
A new `product_id` and `sku_id` is created when generating a virtual bundle product. From a buyer's perspective in TikTok Shop, it is browsed and purchased as a single product.
After a virtual bundle is created, the seller can add or remove the "child" products to the virtual bundle, and the `product_id` and `sku_id` will not change.
This change will allow sellers to use API to map orders that have virtual bundles to be synced back to their systems for fulfillment.
***The virtual bundle has to be created in Seller Center and is not possible to be created via the API. Only the GET Order Detail (and not GET Order List) will return information about virtual bundles.***
