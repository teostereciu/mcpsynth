# US market: Backorder Quantity Thresholds

*Source: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/xmc35tyc*

---

## Summary
We've introduced inventory `backorder_quantity` functionality, which allows sellers to define a backorder quantity **threshold** to continue to capture sales, in the event the physical inventory is temporarily out-of-stock. There also needs to be a `handling_time` defined, which dictates how many days the seller needs to process the backorder and sets the SLA for sending a fulfillment event update to TikTok Shop.

**Important note**: Currently, only select qualified sellers can use the backorder functionality and need to go through TikTok account management for approval. Once the sellers are approved, they **must** activate the backorder functionality on their product detail page within their seller center interface first. There is currently no API functionality to activate the backorder flag on a `product_id` / `sku level`.

Updating `backorder_quantity` thresholds and `handling_time` can only be done through the API after the seller has completed the backorder activation.
