# Summary
**On Time Delivery Rate** (OTDR) is a measurement used to assess a seller's ability to fulfill customer orders within the promised delivery timeframe. OTDR is defined as the percentage of all packages (delivered over a period of 7 calendar days) that take less than **5 business days** to be delivered. 

From **August 25th, 2025**, sellers in the UK and EU using the **Shipped by Seller** (3PL) fulfillment method will receive `delivery_sla_time` data with each order, enabling better management of delivery expectations. OTDR will impact shop health in the future.
