---

## Summary
When calling [Edit Product](edit-product) and [Partial Edit Product APIs](partial-edit-product), the **price** and **inventory** fields are now optional. This change applies to all markets, and both cross-boar and local sellers. Developers integrated with v202309 version of these endpoints can leverage these changes.
## What is changing
The schema of both [Edit Product](edit-product) and [Partial Edit Product APIs](partial-edit-product) have been changed so that `price` and `inventory` are not required anymore. If you omit these objects in the API request, the existing price and inventory will remain unchanged.
## What action is required
No action is required unless you are a developer who will gain flexibility by omitting the above fields.
## What markets and version is affected
This change applies to all markets and all sellers.
