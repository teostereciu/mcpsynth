## Summary
To better support our 2024 Q4 rollout of *3 Day Delivery* through Fulfilled-by-TikTok (FBT), we're adding a merchant badge in Seller Center that more clearly indicates if a seller is offering *3 Day Delivery* for a specific order. We've updated some of our order management APIs to reflect this badge.
