## US Market: Introducing Product LQT (Listing Quality Tiers)
### Summary
Listing quality impacts customer trust and influences purchasing decisions. To improve listing quality, Sellers will be able to see Listing Quality Tiers (LQT), a tier system for measuring listing quality (e.g., "Poor", "Fair", "Good"), and take action to address listing-quality issues. Information quality is a crucial factor for consumers when making purchasing decisions in online shopping. Therefore, improved product information quality directly influences customer satisfaction, trust, and conversion rates. **This change will be for the US market and will be live as of 9/29**
### API Changes
In the US market, the response of [Product Information Issue Diagnosis](product-information-issue-diagnosis) API will now include a `listing_quality` object which will include a listing quality indicator (e.g., "POOR", "FAIR", "GOOD", "EXCELLENT") along with recommendations on what changes to make to get it to the next level, if possible.
