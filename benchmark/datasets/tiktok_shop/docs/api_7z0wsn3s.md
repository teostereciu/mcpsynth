# For all EU markets (EU5) Get Shipping Providers API

# What is changing?
Starting **March 26, 2026**, the **Get Shipping Providers API** has been enhanced to support accurate **EU shipping provider resolution**.
Due to interconnected logistics services within the EU, a single delivery option can correspond to **multiple cross-border shipping routes**. To return the correct shipping provider for a specific route, ISVs are now required to specify both:

* the **shipping origin country** (warehouse), and
* the **destination country** (buyer).

Two new input parameters have been introduced to enable this behavior:

* `warehouse_region`
* `buyer_region`

# **API endpoint changes**

* **Get Shipping Providers**

# **New parameters added:**

* `warehouse_region` – ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the warehouse (shipping origin)
* `buyer_region` – ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the buyer (delivery destination)

When these parameters are provided, the API will return the **shipping provider ID and name** that corresponds to the specified delivery option and cross-border route.
# **Which markets are affected?**

* All **EU markets**
* **Intra-EU cross-border shipping** scenarios

# Who is affected?
Developers and ISVs whose applications:

* Manage logistics, fulfillment, or shipping configuration
* Support **intra-EU delivery flows**
* Resolve shipping providers programmatically using delivery options

# What action is required?

1. Update integrations to pass `warehouse_region` and `buyer_region` when calling **Get Shipping Providers** for EU shipments.
2. Ensure shipping provider resolution logic accounts for **origin–destination combinations**, rather than assuming a single provider per delivery option.

# **General recommendation**

* This API **can be called at parcel level** to determine the correct shipping provider in real time.
* Alternatively, ISVs may **cache shipping provider mappings** and refresh them periodically to stay aligned with the latest logistics configuration.
* If warehouse locations or shipping destinations change frequently, calling the API in real time is recommended to avoid incorrect provider selection.
