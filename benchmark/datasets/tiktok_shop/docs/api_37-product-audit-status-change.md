# (37) Product audit status change

*Source: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/37-product-audit-status-change*

---

## Trigger scenario
When the product audit status changes, you'll receive this webhook.
With this webhook, you can easily get the audit status information of a product instead of calling [Get Product](get-product) API.
To receive this webhook, you must ensure the `Product Basic` API scope is enabled in Partner Center.
