# Context
The Fulfillment API allows sellers to fulfill TikTok Shop orders.
TikTok Shop offers two types of fulfillment types:

1. Fulfilled by TikTok (FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK): TikTok will automatically process the order on behalf of the seller. The seller does not need to manage the fulfillment process.
2. Fulfilled by Seller (FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER): Under this Fulfillment Type, there are two shipping types:

a) TikTok shipping (TIKTOK): Sometimes also referred to as "platform shipping" or "shipped via platform." With this shipping type, the seller purchases shipping labels through TikTok Shop, and schedules a pick-up from a TikTok Shop carrier, or drops off parcels at the TikTok Shop carriers' drop-off locations. The seller can obtain the shipping type from [Get Order Detail](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650aa8ccc16ffe02b8f167a0) or [Get Order List](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650aa8094a0bb702c06df242).
b) Seller shipping (SELLER): Sometimes also referred to as "shipped via seller." The seller manages shipping through their own channel(s). With this shipping type, the sellers call the Fulfillment API to provide shipping details back to TikTok Shop. The seller can obtain shipping type from [Get Order Detail](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650aa8ccc16ffe02b8f167a0) or [Get Order List](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650aa8094a0bb702c06df242).
The Fulfillment API also offers both split-package and consolidated-package (sometimes also referred to as combined package) shipment options to support more flexible shipping needs. The seller can obtain fulfillment type from [Get Order Detail](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650aa8ccc16ffe02b8f167a0) or [Get Order List](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650aa8094a0bb702c06df242).

# Frequently asked questions

1. Can I use shipping service providers outside of the platform's list?
   * No. It will make TikTok unable to obtain shipment tracking information. If TikTok cannot obtain the shipment tracking information within the time specified in cancel_sla_time, the order may be canceled by TikTok.
2. Do I need to handle shipping operations for orders with 'FULFILL_BY_TIKTOK'?
   * No. TikTok will fulfill the order.
3. Can I obtain shipping labels from TikTok at any time?
   * No. A shipping label is only available after shipping has been arranged for a package, and before the package is handed over to the carrier.
4. If I have already handed over the package to the shipping service provider, but the order status on the platform has not progressed to 'IN_TRANSIT', what should I do?
   * First, you need to confirm that the shipping service provider you are using is supported by the platform. If it is confirmed to be supported, please get in touch with the shipping service provider to ensure that the package has been scanned into their system. If you have already tracked the tracking information on the official logistics website but the platform still does not show any tracking details, please contact TikTok for assistance.
