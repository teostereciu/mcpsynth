# What is changing?
When sellers choose the express shipping option to facilitate faster delivery to customers, TikTok Shop will evaluate the shipping and collection time of the orders to provide a satisfactory user experience. In Seller Center, there are notifications to tell sellers about the shipping and collection time window and this change reflects these time windows in the API as `*_due_time` - `shipping_due_time`, `collection_due_time`, and `delivery_due_time`.
There are also three other new properties: `collection_time`, `delivery_time`, `cancel_time` that reflect the actual collection, delivery and cancel time to help sellers have a better view of their order performance.
These fields are available in the response from both the [Get Order List](get-order-list) and [Get Order Details](get-order-detail) APIs.
Additionally, **cancel_order_sla_time** **is** **deprecated**.
# Which markets are affected?
