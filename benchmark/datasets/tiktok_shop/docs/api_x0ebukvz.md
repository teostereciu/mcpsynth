# Overview
This release introduces several new affiliate sample-related capabilities to improve the compliance and automation of the sample application workflow. Additionally, the platform now supports sub-account authorization for affiliate-category apps, allowing merchants to grant permissions to eligible sub-accounts for increased operational flexibility.
## What’s New

* **New API:**[ Seller Get Sample Request Deeplink ](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/seller-get-sample-request-deeplink-202512#Back%20To%20Top)

   This API returns a TikTok deeplink that directs a user to the sample request page within the TikTok app. Sellers can send this deeplink to creators via Instant Messaging (IM) or by encoding it into a QR code for email distribution.

* **New Webhook:**[ Sample Application Status Change](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/urzvzank)

  This webhook sends notifications when a sample application is submitted or its status changes. This allows sellers and developers to receive real-time updates and review applications without relying on high-frequency polling.

* **New Capability:** Sub-account Authorization for Affiliate Apps **** Merchants can now authorize affiliate-category applications using eligible sub-accounts that have the required permissions. This feature enhances flexibility and operational efficiency for managing multiple accounts and roles.


## Important Notes

* The `Sample Application Status Change` webhook helps reduce reliance on polling the `Seller Search Sample Applications` API, leading to better performance and fewer rate-limiting issues.
* Sub-account authorization is only available for applications in the "Affiliate" service category.
