## Technical specification updates
### Making requests
To make requests to the 202309 API endpoints, use URIs with the new structure. Specify the version name (e.g. 202309) in the path instead of as a query parameter. The new version also introduces the resource identifier as a path parameter.


For example, https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/fulfillment/202309/orders/576619223164029995/packages


The URI for each version 202309 endpoint is specified in the [API reference](get-authorized-shops). Check the API reference for the exact endpoint URIs.
### Enumerate data types
We've improved the general concept of statuses to be more descriptive. Previously, order statuses were mapped to codes, which required developer interpretation. We have removed these `int` based codes, and developed `string` based ENUM statuses, such as "UNPAID" and "AWAITING_SHIPMENT" to simplify the development process.


For example:

* v202305 of Get Order Detail API, `order_status` property values are in the `int` type: `100` mean `UNPAID`, `111` means `AWAITING_SHIPMENT`
* v202309 of Get Order Detail API, `order_status` property values are in the `string` type. `UNPAID` and `AWAITING_SHIPMENT` are returned from API.

### Pagination
For standardized expression and performance assurance, we have introduced token-based pagination into our API design. The v202309 API only supports pagination using the `page_size` and `page_token` parameters. The `offset` parameter is no longer supported.
### Authorization
We have deprecated `access_token` usage in the query and now require it to be passed in the HTTP header `x-tts-access-token` for security improvement.
### Signature
The v202309 of the API expands signature protection beyond just path and query parameters. Signatures will now also cover request bodies for POST APIs. To generate the signature for the v202309 APIs, developers need to use the new method.
### Content type
The v202309 APIs now only support `application/json` for non-binary requests. Binary requests should use `multipart/form-data` to ensure efficiency and standards compliance.
### Improved documentation
The API reference pages now include fully populated Errorcode sections at the bottom with the latest error codes and corresponding error description for each endpoint.
# Which markets are affected?
Some new features and enhancement are only available for certain markets or seller types. Refer to "Available in which markets" column in the table above for availability details.


The technical specification updates apply to local and cross-border sellers in all markets.
# Who is affected?
New apps should only use the new v202309 of all API endpoints.


All existing developers are not immediately affected. All legacy APIs will continue functioning. Existing developers are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. New APIs in v202309 offer additional capabilities and enhancements.
# What action is required?
Legacy API versions (pre-Sept 2023) will no longer be supported or maintained from **June 30, 2024** and will be retired on **December 31, 2024**. Existing apps can continue using legacy versions until then, but should upgrade to v202309 as soon as possible.


The following is a list of resources with which developers can learn and upgrade apps with v202309 APIs:

* [API Reference](get-authorized-shops)
* [Developer Guide](tts-developer-guide)
* [Upgrade Guide](upgrading-to-api-version-202309)
* Use [Mapping APIs from legacy to v202309](upgrading-to-api-version-202309#Mapping%20APIs%20from%20legacy%20to%20v202309) to find out what new endpoints to replace with the current legacy API endpoints you are using


After **December 31, 2024** all requests to legacy API versions will fail. Developers should upgrade apps to using v202309 and make sure all requests are on v202309.
