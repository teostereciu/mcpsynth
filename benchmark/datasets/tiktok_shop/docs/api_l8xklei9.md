# Summary
### What are we launching
In the event that non-circulating currencies are sold as commodities, to ensure full regulatory compliance, we will introduce new mandatory attributes to the Get Attributes API. Sellers are required to fully complete all such attributes as a precondition for listing products in the affected product categories.
### When are we launching it
API enforcement for product listings (**Create and Edit Product APIs**) with these compliance attributes will begin after **April 7th, 2026**.
### Impact
All existing and new listings in the affected categories must comply and provide the required information after **April 7th, 2026** to avoid being taken down or receiving listing errors.
### Which markets are impacted?
Only the **US market** will be impacted at this time.
